I know you must be going through tough times right now, so I wanted to create this post to show my support to the great Palestinian nation in their fight for freedom!

You have caused the zionists a great amount of pain today, through determination and smart planning. They are always the ones who invade your homes, and you decided it's your time to invade theirs!

This is a great inspiration to be written in the pages of history, and it reminds me of my country's fight for freedom against the Soviets in the winter war. Both of our nations were fighting an evil empire that looked down on us and got a nasty surprise in return.

Keep doing what you're doing and don't listen to anyone who tells you it's wrong. Their offspring will just turn into more evil soldiers, no matter how young, and their females will just create more offspring.

As for the ""innocents"" killed in the upbriging of events from the israeli side, let's paraphrase the hypocritical jargons they constantly say whenever a palestinian perishes amidst their bloody military incursions:

Of Course, Israel is most probably going to do much, MUCH worse than what it did before. So, I pray for the Palestinians that they make it out of this and that both parties find a peaceful solution.

172t2g7,“Uprising in Palestine” by Tariq Ali,"In December 1987, a new intifada erupted in Palestine, shaking Israel as well as the elites of the Arab world. A few weeks later, the grand old Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani wrote ‘The Trilogy of the Children of Stones’, in which he denounced the older generation of Palestinian leaders – today represented by the corrupt, collaborationist Palestine (No-)Authority. It was sung and recited in many a Palestinian café:

The children of the stones

have scattered our papers

spilled ink on our clothes

mocked the banality of old texts…

O Children of Gaza

Don’t mind our broadcasts

Don’t listen to us

We are the people of cold calculation

Of addition, of subtraction

Wage your wars and leave us alone

We are dead and tombless

Orphans with no eyes.

Children of Gaza

Don’t refer to our writings

Don’t be like us.

We are your idols

Don’t worship us.

O mad people of Gaza,

A thousand greetings to the mad

The age of political reason has long departed

So teach us madness…

Since then, the Palestinian people have tried every method to achieve some form of meaningful self-determination. ‘Renounce violence’, they were told. They did, apart from the odd reprisal after an Israeli atrocity. Among Palestinians at home and in the diaspora, there was massive support for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions: a peaceful movement par excellence, which began to gain traction worldwide among artists, academics, trade unions and occasionally governments. The US and its NATO family responded by trying to criminalize BDS across Europe and North America – claiming, with the help of Zionist lobby groups, that boycotting Israel was ‘antisemitic’. This has proved largely effective. In Britain, Keir Starmer’s Labour Party has banned any mention of ‘Israeli apartheid’ at its upcoming national conference. The Labour left, scared of being expelled, has fallen silent on this issue. A sorry state of affairs. Meanwhile, most of the Arab states have joined Turkey and Egypt in capitulating to Washington. Saudi Arabia is currently in negotiations, mediated by the White House, to officially recognize Israel. The international isolation of the Palestinian people looks set to increase. Peaceful resistance has gone nowhere.  

All the while, the IDF has attacked and killed Palestinians at leisure, while successive Israeli governments have worked to sabotage any hope of statehood. Recently, a handful of former IDF generals and Mossad agents have admitted that what is being done in Palestine amounts to ‘war crimes’. But they only plucked up the courage to say this after they’d already retired. While still serving, they fully supported the fascist settlers in the occupied territories, standing by as they burned houses, destroyed olive plantations, poured cement in wells, attacked Palestinians and drove from their homes while chanting ‘Death to the Arabs’. So, too, did Western leaders – who let all this unfold without a murmur. The age of political reason had long departed, as Qabbani would say.

Then, one day, the elected leadership in Gaza begins to fight back. They break out of their open-air prison and cross Israel’s southern border, striking at military targets and settler populations. Palestinians are suddenly top of the international headlines. Western journalists are shocked and horrified that they are actually resisting. But why shouldn’t they? They know better than anyone that the far-right government in Israel will retaliate viciously, backed by the US and the mealy-mouthed EU. But even so, they are unwilling to sit by as Netanyahu and the criminals in his cabinet gradually expel or kill most of their people. They know that the fascist elements of the Israeli state would have no compunction about sanctioning the mass murder of Arabs. And they know this must be resisted by any means necessary. Earlier this year, Palestinians watched the demonstrations in Tel Aviv earlier and understood that those marching to ‘defend civil rights’ did not care about the rights of their occupied neighbours. They decided to take matters into their own hands.  

Do the Palestinians have a right to resist the non-stop aggression to which they are subjected? Absolutely. There is no moral, political or military equivalence as far as the two sides are concerned. Israel is a nuclear state, armed to the teeth by the US. Its existence is not under threat. It’s the Palestinians, their lands, their lives, that are. Western civilization seems willing to stand by while they are exterminated. They, on the other hand, are rising up against the colonizers.

**Background**  
I have been born and raised in Israel, near Tel-Aviv. I lean left politically, but consider myself to be somewhat politically homeless with the current parties.

I heavily dislike the Likud party, Bibi and the current government, and I believe both Jews and Palestinians deserve to live in peace and security.

As for my views, I am sympathetic to the suffering of the Palestinians, and am opposed to the expansion of the settlements in the West Bank, but I don't see a way for peace as long as Hamas control Gaza and threaten to take over a potential Palestinian state in the West Bank.

I hope this post can open respectful dialogue to explain my point of view, as well as to understand the POV of Palestinians.

Since the post was locked I cannot respond to any of the comments (despite what the mod's comments says. I'll assume it's just human error). Sorry folks.",bendking,2023-11-23,132,0.64,70,0

17eifu3,"The Nakba, Hamas and cognitive dissonance","The thing I can't get past is the cognitive dissonance. This applies to people who think Hamas' murder of civilians was a noble or justified act of resistance but also to the much larger number of people who engage in Nakba denial.

On October 7th Hamas went from village to village killing civilians indiscriminately. We should be prepared to call it what it is: a war crime. No prior act against Palestinians justifies it. It was terrorism. Hamas may or may not be a militia or a militant group but this was terrorism. Pure and simple. We should be able to call it for what it is without equivocating.

In 1948, Zionist militias went from village to village killing civilians indiscriminately. Without these massacres, which triggered the mass exodus of Palestinian civilians that created the demographic majority of Jews Zionist leaders had sought for several decades, there would be no Israel as we know it.

The millions of supporters of Israel either insist that the massacres didn't happen or that they did happen but Palestinians deserved it AND view the events around the Nakba as a glorious and miraculous birth of liberated Jewish nation are every bit as extreme as people justifying Hamas.

The difference is: Hamas is a proscribed group, almost entirely eschewed by the international community and which enjoys maybe 25% support among voting age Palestinians. Israel's terrorists have never faced justice of accountability. Still feted as statesmen, freedom fighters, moral military men. People can celebrate events in 1948, which is basically a celebration of the mass murder and ethnic cleansing of Palestinian civilians, and still call themselves progressives or ""liberal"" Zionists.

How the fuck does anyone with a brain think the Nakba took place? Even before we examine the historical record and the IDF's own archives, we know the answer. Through acts of terror designed to do exactly what they archieved. Sow enough fear that ordinary people packed up their families, left their homes behind and walked away with no guarantees they would ever be able to come back.",MrBoonio,2023-10-23,2,0.53,11,0

17d3pe4,AP News thinks Hospital Explosion likely occured because of a Stray rocket,"According to AP News, their team mainly analysed video footage, satellitte imagery and photos to come to the conclusion that a rocket was fired from within Gaza ans that the rocket crashed causing the Explosion. They also used text evidence from Hamas and Islamic Jihad telegrams that said that they had launched a strike in response to 'massacre against civilians'.

Wonder what you guys think about this, I thought AP News was one of the most credible News sources out there but the lack of evidence against the Narrative that they are pushing is shocking to me. No discussion of Israel's pathological habit of lying when committing war crimes, no discussion of Israel's love of bombing hospital and healthcare facilities (look up the WHO and their stats), no discussion about the gigantic Explosion and the idea that its kinda hard to believe that a poorly armed terrorist group has that much explosive yield, if they did wouldn't Israel literally have far more deaths from these rockets over the years? Not to mention other reports from Channel 4 and Al Jazeera that talk about effects such as the doppler effect, when viewing the strike against the hospital you can hear the sound, and that sounds exactly like an air strike. I guess they must be Pro-Zionist then.

Israel has a large Moroccan diaspora on one side, and we're a Muslim country on the other. Before the normalization agreements we played an important role in mediating between Israel and Palestine.

17nct84,I used to be pro-Palestinian.,"I used to be pro-Palestinian, you know. I thought Israel was wrong for carpet bombing Gaza and using siege warfare on civilians.

But then I ran into a very wise Israel apologist who changed my way of looking at things forever.

I was walking down the street and I saw him leaning against a lamp post, smoking a pipe as wise men do.

“Your shirt says Free Palestine,” he said from behind a plume of smoke.

“Yep!” I replied.

“So I guess that means you love Hamas then?” spake he.

I stopped in my tracks. I’d never thought of it that way before. 

Could it be? Could my opposition to murdering civilians really be indicative  of a deep affection for a Gazan militant group? Maybe I really did love  Hamas and think everything it did on October 7 was great and wonderful?

“Is this really how I want to live my life?” I thought to myself.

“I — I — I…” I said out loud.

“Or perhaps,” he said with a raised eyebrow, “you just HATE JEWS??”

I fell to my knees. 

Oh my God. He really had a point. What possible reason could anyone have  for opposing military explosives being dropped on buildings full of  children besides a seething lifelong hatred of adherents to the religion of Judaism? How could anyone possibly oppose siege warfare tactics  which cut off civilians from food and water and electricity and fuel and medical supplies unless they harboured dangerously negative opinions  about members of a small Abrahamic faith?

“Who… who are you?” I asked.

“That’s of no consequence,” he said, casually blowing a smoke ring through another larger smoke ring.

“But… but the children,” I stammered as my entire world-view crumbled before  my eyes. “The civilians! They’re dying! Isn’t it bad that they’re  dying?”

And then he delivered the coup de grâce.

“Have you considered,” he said before a pregnant pause, “… that all of those deaths are the fault of Hamas?”

It was like a 50 megaton nuclear explosion went off inside my brain. 

I fell flat on my back. The world was spinning. A trickle of blood ran down into my hair from my ear.

I felt all the anti-colonialism leaving my body. I suddenly could no  longer remember why I thought it was bad to rain down military  explosives on a densely populated concentration camp.

Everything went black.

When I finally came to, the mysterious stranger was gone. But his wisdom and profound insights into Israel and Gaza will always live on in my heart.

2ahzrk,Zionists in horrific and fraudulent denial - does it give them a thrill?,"One of my first postings at Reddit was in response to this statement:

*""... why do we allow people who regularly post from such antisemitic sites like Electronic Intifada, the site who regularly prints antisemitic blood libels such as the accusation of organ thieving by the IDF and other classical antisemitic libels""*

Makes me wonder how evil people must be to act as Harvesting Deniers.

My response to that posting was measured and respectful, it went as follows:

*""I'm sure you'd not wish to attack Electronic Intifada on the basis of the organ-harvesting allegations - which were clearly admitted by the relevant Israeli authorities.""*

*""OK, so they only actually admitted to stealing corneas but it is alleged that 100s of the bodies of Palestinians are still missing from the 1990s (just as they are from the 1940s and 2000s - none from the 2010s as yet).*""

*""What say you Israel produce the bodies (along with the photographs taken at Deir Yassin, still under wraps 65 years after the event)?
Then we could lay some of these dreadful calumnies to rest.""*

What happened? Why, at least 20 sick people came along and voted me down. (At one time it was on -20, so that was 21 Harvesting Deniers)

are the Palestinians willing to peacefully co-exist with Israel?

And what kind of terms would be necessary for the Palestinians to reach such an agreement of co-existence?

txt4ex,Why such contrary trends in the West with regard to I/P?,"On the one hand, it's clear that more and more people (especially since Gaza 2014) are starting to seriously oppose Israeli policies, especially in the center and on the left. Even centrist conservatives such as David Cameron admitted to being sick of Gaza situation, settlements and the rest.

On the other hand, there is more and more pro-Israel anti-BDS anti-anti-Zionist legislation, which occasionally stifles free speech, together with accusations of antisemitism, and all this coming not just from the Right but from the Liberals and the moderate Left as well. Remember Macron equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism, Democrats voting for anti-BDS resolution, Corbyn's downfall and so on.

Both of these trends are running concurrently for the last 5-6 years.

If Israelis were to suddenly leave, there would arrive a power vacuüm which will be tried to filled by Hamas but also other organisations, and likely there would be war and it will all just be a mess again.

Wouldn’t it be just better then to just give up the not realistic hope for a sovereign state and instead protest for equal rights in Israel, as Israeli citizens then? I mean, wouldn’t that be better for everyone?

I know the Israeli government doesn’t make it easy for you to do that. But if you dismissed yourself from Hamas & co and showed you were truly willing to integrate into Israeli society, hoping for peacy, prosperity and love, surely there will be something to achieve for you guys. Something realistic.

3oh07g,Brief look at the Israeli media bias and dehumanization of Palestinians,"There’s a lot that can be said, but nothing that would be considered *good.* Anybody who reads the Israeli media will notice an interesting trend or pattern that has been emerging for some time now. It tends to become even more evident during times when tensions are high, but it always exists. The Israeli media will generally refer to Palestinians as “Arabs”, and Israelis simply as “Jews”. Depending which media outlet is in question, the article may go as far to not even refer to an individual as an Arab, but as “the terrorist” or “rioter.” No sense of humanity is found in the news articles. Further, when Palestinians are described by their names – “Palestinians”, it is only in order to denote some sort of negative connotation to them. The word Palestinian always will come preceding the word “terrorist.” This sense the Israeli media is doing a great job at separation between the peoples. I’m worried those that consistently read these news reports not only will have a skewed view on the developments, but will form some sort of bias mental divide. 

I suppose it wouldn’t do any good without giving some examples. Sadly, evidence of this is very easy to find and to prove this I’ll just take a look at some of today’s headlines from Arutz Sheva, Jpost, and ynet. An [article dated 12 October] (http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/201763#.VhveCZVdF7d) in Arutz Sheva titled “Stabbing Attack in Jerusalem; one injured. The content of the article refers to the attacker is briefly described as “*The terrorist who carried out the attack, an Arab woman from eastern Jerusalem*”. The article then also explains that the “*Police also arrested an Arab man suspected of acting as her accomplice,*.” There is no mention of the names of these individuals, and no mention that they are *East Jerusalem Palestinians* living under an Israeli military occupation. They simply are the terrorists, whose characteristics are simply “Arabs.” 

In the Jpost today, the first major headline reads: “*root of terrorism is that Palestinians don't want Israel to exist.*” Meanwhile the rest of the front page is covered in reports about stabbing attacks or “terror.” Another distasteful headline found in Jpost today reads reads [“Gazan rioters breach border fence, IDF units fire tear gas.”] (http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Gazan-rioters-breach-border-fence-IDF-units-fire-tear-gas-423735) Here the use of the word Palestinian is non-existent, and of course no mention of the blockade or of Israel’s buffer zone. The Palestinians living under an Israeli siege in Gaza are only described as ""rioters"". Another [headline in Jpost] (http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Initial-report-Stabbing-attack-in-Pisgat-Zev-third-of-day-in-Jerusalem-423719) regarding a stabbing attack only uses the word Palestinian as long as “terrorist” follows immediately after it. Yet, the article still uses language such as “Arab assailant.” Once again, no mention of the forceful restrictions Israel has imposed on East Jerusalem’s Palestinian community, nor any mention of Israeli violence towards Palestinians. 

Meanwhile in ynetnews [reporting on] (http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4709978,00.html) the same and other knife attacks, uses similar language as the other outlets. The perpetrator of the attack in this instance was a “female terrorist” who wounded a boy in a “Jewish neighborhood.” Notice how they go as far to designate certain neighborhoods “Jewish” or “Arab”? Acknowledging Israel's segregationist policies, but phrasing it as if apartheid is absolutely normal. Once again, the national identity of these inviduals as Palestinians is completely non-existent in this article. No mention of Israel’s restrictive measures or military occupation. Only that there are designated Jewish villages that undergo attacks by terrorists; sometimes who are described as “Arab” depending on the article. Looking through the front page there are almost no articles of substance or analysis. On any arbitrary day, such as today in fact, you’ll find a piece of propaganda about some Arab or “self-hating” Jew who *“saw the light”*; for lack of a better way to explain it. In this case the article is titled [“I despised myself for hating Israel.”] (http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4704402,00.html) The very first sentence reads “*Egyptian Sharif Gaber's video explains how logic ended his hate of Israel…*” Not only do headlines such as this imply that the propagandized Israeli narrative is the truth, but also that Arabs hate Israel because they lack logical thinking. It's truly disgusting and only feeds into the racism we see today when privileged Jewish lynch mobs living on stolen land in occupied territory chant death to the Arabs -- once again ""Arabs"" not Palestinians. The Israeli media has done a great job at denying Palestinian existence, especially in Jerusalem.

I’m going to end this post by saying that I find the Israeli media truly disgusting. They deliberately do a very poor job on reporting the issues and are more concerned about the language they use rather than real journalism. Any mention of the military occupation over Palestine, Israeli violence, or Palestinian suffering is literally non-existent within their daily news, and that’s to say if they even mention the Palestinians at all as anything more than ""terrorists"" or “Arabs.” 

Let’s stop pretending that these are real, reliable sources for news. There is absolutely no attempt to *not be bias.* In fact, there is a clear attempt to actually report on the issues with bias, or at the very least ignore Palestinian nationalist interests. 

Anyway, Peace

If tomorrow you could make this a reality would you? If so why or why not? 

Don't focus too much on how viable each parameter is. I would like to ask whether you find these terms agreeable and would recognize Israel if this could happen.

My solution:

\+ Two states with 67 borders with a period of Palestinian demilitarization (15 years maybe)

\+ All Palestinian political parties must agree to demilitarize under the protection of a trusted foreign power until it can independently remilitarize (For example under saudi defense under the condition Saudi recognize Israel)

\+ Separate Israeli and Palestinian referendum votes that must pass at least 60% in each state to give assurances that most people want peace.

\+ Settlers can leave or receive Palestinian citizenship, Same with arab and bedouin Israelis

\+ Palestinain right of return

\+ Both states prosecute those who incite

\+ East Jerusalem as the Capital of Palestine with special temporary permits for Israelis who want to visit.

Friedman, I was hit with an idea that is probably extremely stupid, but I’d like to share it anyways. What if the West Bank is given to Jordan, and the Gaza Strip to Egypt. This plan would give Palestinians the protection and equality they deserve and need. One obvious problem would be that many Palestinians will not like this plan. While this is true, it also gives Palestinians more stability. Problems like COVID-19 vaccinations wouldn’t be a problem. When lines were first drawn, Palestinians on the East Bank were split from their West Bank brothers/sisters, but they were found to be in a much better place than those on the other side of the river. If given citizenship to Jordan and Egypt, Palestinians would not be considered second-hand citizens, as they are in Israel. I can see benefits from this, but once again, I am not Palestinian. I’d like to hear some feedback to see how you all feel about this plan. Like I said before, this is probably just stupid.

8wlbwg,"Yes, Israel murders people and loves murdering them. Discourse has to shift to the issue of the Israel Lobby/Jewish Lobby since that is what sustains and protects Israel.","One never truly reaches an end or a conclusion when they start discussing the many horrid, vile things the racist, apartheid, genocidal, supremacist state of Israel does. Arguments such as 'did Hamas or Israel start the current Israeli bombing campaign' (the occupying force is the aggressor, and occupations are never benign, thus featuring continuous crimes in between every large scale genocide) or 'how many resolutions from the UN did Israel violate again?' should've been shelved ages ago and true targeted, objectives-driven activism taken up.

To pique the interest of those who have thus far stuck to merely discussing Israel's physical crimes, here's a nice opening into a better view at the Israel situation. [Israel stole weapons-grade uranium from the US, while supposedly being an 'ally'.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/israeli-prime-minister-netanyahu-linked-to-nuclear-technology-smuggling-ring---fbi-files-164155046.html)

I wouldn't call it a master-slave relationship in those very terms, since what essentially happens is Israel, via its Lobby, leeches off the US Treasury, alienates the US from potential partners and creates new enemies for it to use its resources fighting, and makes the US a despised entity in a region as important as the Middle East.

In exchange for US recognition of our southern provinces (plus some arms deals), we agreed to recognize Israel. But that in itself is not a betrayal, as he we still continue to stand together with our Palestinian brothers and we will continue to support them, albeit with official links with Israel this time.

Anyways, let me ask you this question. Let's say Israel offered peace, the recognition of Gaza and the West Banks, sharing of Jerusalem and recalled all of its settlers and military. But in exchange you have to recognize and support their claims on all the Golan Heights, a territory that was taken from Syria in a past war. Would you take it?

That's a really hard choice, but we all know and agree on which decision is the most logical one.

That should give you some insight on our part. As much as we support you, we got our own problems that we have to deal with. It doesn't mean we have forgotten Palestine, not at all. We'll continue to support Palestinian rights as we have done previously. The only difference is that we now recognize Israel. It's not an outcome that you probably wished for, but it's the only one we could make in our situation. Please don't judge us too harshly.

Anyways, best of luck to you all :)

EDIT: Different scenario for similar results.

173tczn,Call in a major Israeli newsite to commit genocide in Gaza,"(use Google translate if you want to read the original text)

https://finance.walla.co.il/item/3614765

This is a major article on one of the biggest and most important news websites in Israel, called ""walla"".

This article essentially cries that Nethanyahu is too weak to order a massive strike on Gaza, that will avenge the operation started two days ago by Hammas. He writes several times that Israel has the capacity to ""wipe out"" the Gaza strip but ""unfortunately will not do it"" due to politics. He also claims that 90% of Israeli Jews ""are united in the expectation that Gaza will be wiped out at any moment"".

The article also cries about how now the world is sympathetic to Israel having seen images and videos of the operation, but ""as always"" once Israel start bombing Gaza they will be seen as war criminals (gee, I wonder why).

To me it reads as a piece intended to put pressure on the government to commit mass murder in Gaza.

I lived in Israel for most of my life, yet I've never seen such fervor for commiting a genocide against Palestinians. I'm scared of what might happen. This is insane.",echtemendel,2023-10-09,0,0.48,2,1

Little background: Gil-Shuster is a Zionist that asks Israelis and Palestinians questions that people send him. Many of his questions are ""pointy"" and mean to prove someone's point (e.g ""What is the difference between Palestinians and Syrians?"" asked to Palestinians), but sometimes his videos reveal something interesting.

In this video, he asks Israelis ""Would you move to a West Bank settlement?"" Interestingly, the most common answer is ""Because it is dangerous"" and only one answers ""Because the land is not ours.""

Maybe I'm wrong here, but isn't it logical to conclude that *more* Israelis would move to settlements if the West Bank became *less* dangerous for them and *less* Israelis would move to settlements if the West Bank became *more* dangerous for them?! At least it is clear that very few Israelis actually believe in the Two-state solution because then moving to settlements would be taboo.",bjourne2,2020-08-23,1,0.53,3,0

173x8i9,"I got sick and cannot protest for Palestine, tell me what I can do to support Palestine?","Salam everyone,

So originally I was supposed to go to a protest today but last night I got sick and I thought I could get rid of the sickness in time so I went out to buy zinc and took 50 mg of zinc and woke up this morning coughing out a bunch of phlegm feeling a bit better and my head although late last night it was feeling like it was the budding of a fever now it is so much better but it mildly hurts (so no fever anymore). I've been contemplating on what to do because I must show support for Palestine and the Palestinian cause and I was going to do this today by going to the protest. Everyone basically is telling me to stay home because I am not fully healthy yet, I am still fairly sick and I would risk getting even more sick by being outside, exposed to the elements and to people's coughing, sneezing and general uncleanliness which would worsen my state.

So this has bummed me out because I've been sharing stuff on my IG story in support of Palestine, but I still feel like I can't do anything. I know some people in Gaza and they are telling me that this is going to be the last time we ever talk, their neighbour got bombed, a family of six all gone and they said no one is safe. My other friend in Gaza, I was calling him over and over again with no response, hours later, he texts me that they shut off the electricity. I believe that I need to do something. I cannot do nothing. This is disgusting absolutely evil what is happening to the people of Gaza. So, since I cannot protest, what can I do then? I have no problems making online content to inform or educate people, nor do I have any problems donating money, but I really do not know what to do in this time. Please suggest me some stuff that I can do. If it is content I can make, tell me about what topics to cover. If it's charities please let me know. I want to help and I feel so crappy and useless that I cannot even just simply protest for the people of Palestine who need our help because I got sick.",goldennCookie,2023-10-09,0,0.46,5,0

12owi5b,There was not a distinct Palestinian identity before the creation of Israel. This is NOT a bad thing.,"Pan-Arabism emerged mainly in modern day Egypt and Syria as a struggle for **independence** against the Ottoman Empire and the European colonial powers (Britain, France, and Italy). Israeli Jews will often depict Pan-Arabism as a form of “Arab Muslim supremacy”, but really **most**, if not all, of the founders and fundamental contributors to Pan-Arabism were Levantine Christians (to give a few examples: Jurji Zaydan- Lebanese Christian, Emil Ghuri- Palestinian Christian, and Michel Aflaq- Syrian Christian). 

The goal of Pan-Arabism was to essentially liberate Levantine and Egyptian territories from the Ottoman Empire and the European colonial powers, and unite these territories as *ONE* Arab nation, with respect to different ethnicities, religions, and cultures. The “Arab” identity *would not* be imposed on anyone, “Arab” would just be the name of the state; so, for example, Egyptians would continue to call themselves “Egyptian”, Levantines (including Palestinians) “Syrian”, Armenians “Armenian”, Jews “Jewish”, etc. Pan-Arabism was a secular ideology, giving room to different ethnicities, religions, and cultures, unlike Pan-Islamism which is antithetical to Pan-Arabism.

How could anyone see unity as a bad thing? Why do Israeli Jews think it’s such a [“gotcha” moment](https://twitter.com/ChaimSmierc/status/1535038457067732999) when they figure out, for example, that Palestine and Jordan were supposed to be one country (“Syria”) with no borders preventing people from moving to Al Quds, Amman, Damascus or Cairo if they wanted to?

*Because* the Zionist movement is *inherently* colonial and racist, it’s meant to separate people by ethnic, religious, and cultural means and favor one group of people over all others. This is why the Middle Eastern borders exist today, to divide and conquer us so the Zionist entity and the Western countries maintain their power in our countries. Like, when the founding fathers of Zionism call themselves  [“colonialists”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2535975) and speak of building an [“iron wall which the native Arabs can’t breach”](http://en.jabotinsky.org/media/9747/the-iron-wall.pdf), I think that says enough about Zionism. 

Obviously, there is a Palestinian identity now, and Israeli Jews simply can’t make Palestinians disappear by saying, “There is no such thing as Palestinians”. There are millions of people who call themselves “Palestinian”, and they are angry. Very angry. They want their country back from the colonialists and they are losing patience.",Accomplished-Yam7102,2023-04-17,0,0.5,1,1

If that is the case, Isreal needs to give it back. If it wasn't for Palestine, they won't have a state. But at the same time, saying that they should have no land and Isreal shouldn't exist is racist in my opinion. Isreal was only created as a gift from the German people for exterminating Jews. Imagine if there was an Arab state and Jews state that your state shouldn't exist and that you don't deserve any land. Fucked up right? You are playing into the minds of Hitler. He knew this would happened if the German people showed any sympathy. He knew that Jewish people would be discriminated no matter how the German population worded it and that no matter how much the US and European countries state that Jews have rights, some people wouldn't listen. Those people are Palestinians. If there was an Arab Hitler and if Germany gave you a state for refuge. If you experience the same thing in Isreal, then your whole purpose of living there is wrong.

2ajwez,Why do Palestinians stay? Why not abandon the place and start a new life somewhere else?,"I've been watching the Israel/Palestinian conflict for as far back as I can remember.  A question I often find myself asking is why don't the Palestinian citizens apply for amnesty somewhere and just leave?  What is keeping them there?  

I don't see much in the way of resources, the land is harsh scrubland and aside from a few unique holy sites, the buildings are the same across the region.  Is it out of principle?  The idea that they would rather die than give in?  Is it religious?  I really don't understand what they are fighting for.

To give some context, I know a group of Indian Muslims who were being oppressed in India.  They were beyond poor, mud hut living subsistence farmers.  As a community, they started pooling their very meager resources and began sending their best and brightest kids to private schools and universities.  Those kids became doctors and engineers and moved to the States and to Europe.  A portion of the money they made went back to their community in India, and more kids were sent to university.  In time - about 40 years - the entire community migrated to the US and Europe.  They abandoned India completely and now are doing very well.   All of them are doctors, engineers, chemists, and business people - even the women.  They didn't give up their faith, they didn't give up their community.

What's stopping the Palestinians from following this method?  

***EDIT

I know that Palestine has modernized.  I wasn't insinuating that Palestinians live in mud huts, I was using this other community as an extreme example: if they could restart their lives starting with absolutely nothing, why couldn't the Palestinians do the same when they are much better off to begin with?

But I just wanted to add that reading through comments and articles about Palestine on the larger subreddits are nauseating. They're all overwhelmingly pro-Israel with no reasoning other than ""Muslims and Arabs are terrorist barbarians, and Israel is our friend."" Maybe 1 in 50 comments are pro-Palestine/critical of Israel, and they're almost all downvoted into oblivion. No critical thinking, no care for fellow human beings that are different. Living in the US, I can see public opinion has slowly started to charge, and people are questioning Israel's tactics, finally aware of the bullying and state terrorism on their part. But actions like in the last week or so have set back people's thoughts on the situation 10 years. I was saddened to hear about the death of Mahdi Hamad of the PFLP (and his family). The revolutionary left lost an important leader in Palestine.

Also a quick unrelated question: on the sidebar, the flag is vertical and green, white, black. Is this the proper way to hang one vertically? I'm double checking before I move mine from my wall to my window in solidarity with the people being terrorized by Israel.

r99r16,The importance of Islam to Muslims,"بسم الله الرحمان الرحيم

This is in relation to recent discussions on this sub.

Imagine someone saying they are pro-Palestine then saying they are happy to give up Paletinian right of return. It is a contradictory statement that most of the people on this sub would rightly want to correct or comment on.

For believers, Islam is much more important than any wordly cause. As a Palestinian, I can honestly say that my faith is much more important to me than the Palestinian cause, which is an extremely important part of who I am.

I understand that it may make some uncomfortable when an action deemed as unislamic is ""called out"" on a public platform, especially in a space like this. And like everything else, it can be taken too far. If a discussion gets out of hand in a comment section, I trust the Mods are more than capable of dealing with it, regardless of who they side with.

Whatever haram things anyone does in the privacy of their own homes is between them and their lord. But when someone publically says ""As a Muslim, I do x haram thing"", Muslims will advise this individual publically.

This is not about erasing Palestinian Christians, this is not about making Palestine a cause only for Muslims. We respect all those fighting for justice regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. This is simply about making it clear that we Muslims hold our faith miles above anything else in our lives.",,2021-12-05,4,0.56,22,1

18smj81,My Peace Plan (Feedback Requested) - The Delayed Layered Onion Peace Plan,"Hi guys, I want to submit to you guys my peace plan so I can get some feedback, criticism and questions. I call it the Delayed Layered Onion Peace Plan. Please point out where you disagree. Thanks

**Disclaimer:** This is a plan of how to get a two-state solution across the finish line.

**Current Hurdles to the 2ss:**

1. The pursuit of Justice & assigning blame. Both sides have gone through incredible pain, injustice and suffering. Peace talks can easily get derailed by trying to assign blame. **Justice is not the goal, peace is the goal**. 99.9% of online conversations regarding the conflict are assigning blame. It's a waste of time.
2. Lack of political incentives for stepping forward. Leaders from both sides will face real and credible death threats for making peace. On the Palestinian side, leaders have become incredibly wealthy from the conflict, they would have to be willing to sacrifice future payments. For Israeli leaders, the risk of a potential peace process ending in more violence outweighs the potential political reward of making peace.
3. The UN and NGOs are not peace-inducing, they're conflict-agitating. We need to recognise that the UN, NGOs and UNRWA are not agents of peace. They exacerbate the conflict through political posturing and assigning blame. They cannot play a role in peace and should be ignored.
4. Radicals on both sides do not want peace. They will work hard to derail it and recruit others to join them in their quest.
5. Israel's security concerns. Israel have legitimate security concerns so they will need to be addressed.
6. Lack of trust on both sides. Palestinians feel the Israelis are not sincere in negotiations and they just want to build more settlements and expand. Israelis feel that should Palestinians have control of the West Bank it will turn into something like Gaza and used to launch attacks.
7. Education on both sides teaches to hate. I am not sure to what extent but I have seen many leaks of UNRWA schools teaching the glory of destroying Israel and killing Jews etc. My understanding is that Israeli education is near top of the world but their teachers should be vetted for hate.

So we need a process that combats all these hurdles. Here is my process:

1. Leaders from both sides and from around the world negotiate on what an ideal two-state solution looks like 100 years from now in an ideal world. The negotiations should happen under the assumption that in this distant future there is no more violence, hate and radicalisation. Leaders should agree on what an ideal hypothetical scenario looks like. This is not binding, this will not be implemented tomorrow, this is an agreement on what life would look like with two peaceful states side by side.
2. I will throw out what I think this probably looks like. A Palestinian state encompassing all of West Bank and Gaza with an underground tunnel connecting them. Most of East Jerusalem as their capital with an independent mini-state (similar to the Vatican) set up to govern the significant holy sites with fair access to all. Almost all settlements would be dismantled except for the large settlements, they will remain but exist within the Palestinian state. Many people will find the idea of a Palestinian government ruling over Jewish settlements unrealistic, but remember this exists in a future where there is no desire for violence (think Northern Ireland today) where Jews and Arabs could in theory peacefully coexist. Besides, all residents of these settlements will be given options to move to Israel with compensation should they desire. Unlimited right of return to the Palestinian state. No right of return to Israel. This is just approx what I think would be agreed upon, ultimately its down to the leaders in the negotiations rooms. The goal here is to meet the aspirations for both sides. Israel will remain a Jewish State and a safe haven for Jews. Palestinians will have a state in their homeland with the right of return and self-determination.
3. Next step is to agree upon a timeline to achieve this, I suggest 100 years. The timeline allows both sides to deradicalise, slowly build trust with each other and to be frank, just enough time for generations of people filled with hate to die.
4. Next is to split the 100-year period into phases of progress. The first phase will begin with a small Palestinian state and with each phase there are slow but sure steps toward the final and complete Palestinian state as agreed upon in step 1. The idea is that as we progress through the phases with no violence, trust between both populations grows and we can end up with our ideal scenario as discussed in step 2.
5. Phase 1 is the most difficult and important. As we spoke about before there is little political incentive for either side to proceed and there is little trust in the other side so phase 1 will have to be mostly symbolic and the aim is to build trust and deradicalise. It will start off with a new recognised State of Palestine with a  new government & education system focused on peace and coexistence with strong oversight from UAE & Saudi. The new state would have total control over Area A and Gaza strip for the first phase. During this phase, Palestine will have no army, airport or control over their airspace. They will have an overfunded police/anti-terrorism force with intelligence cooperation with UAE, Saudi and Israel. At the same time, Israel starts dismantling all settlements in Area C (sending settlers into Israel proper) and get ready to sign a sliver of it over to Palestine in the second phase (think of a layered onion here, each phase means a new layer of the onion becoming Palestine). You get the idea now, phase by phase, sliver by sliver, Palestine becomes bigger, fuller and works towards the goal of total independent Palestine envisaged in Step 1.
6. Punishments must be agreed upon. In any phase, should either side allow their radicals to take an action to potentially derail this process (think terrorist attacks from either side, rockets being fired etc etc) then appropriate and permanent repercussions for that state. Example: should an Israeli settler run into a Palestinian town and murder someone then an additional sliver of Israeli land will be qued up to be annexed over to Palestine. The reverse is also true, should a Palestinian faction fire rockets into Israel then the last sliver of land meant to complete the final Palestinian state is now set to remain part of Israel. The goal here is to keep the incentives for everyone in line with what we all want. And should Israel or Palestine end up smaller than the agreed-upon ideal scenario they only have themselves to blame.
7. This sets the wheels in motion for a 100 year slow walk towards the 2ss. It gives enough time for pain, hate and radicals to fade away and allows time for trust to build slowly. In my view the key is to create poor conditions for radicalisation, this is good education, proper policing and economic opportunity.

&#x200B;

**Criticisms of the plan:**

1. **Question:** This is a racist plan, why do the Palestinians have to wait for 100 years in poor conditions and the Israelis do not? How is this fair?**Answer:** As I said before the goal is peace not justice, having said that lack of economic opportunity does lead to good conditions for radical groups to recruit and grow. For that reason economic conditions for Palestinians must be must improve greatly in phase 1. I watched an interview with Jared Krushner on Lex Freidman and he said during his attempt at a peace plan that many wealthy Arab businessmen wanted to invest in Palestine but couldn't due to lack of trust in the government. These businessmen will be encouraged greatly during phase 1. Loads of infrastructure and projects must spring up during phase 1 to show the Palestinians the future. This will make it more difficult for radical groups to recruit.
2. **Question:** What exactly do the Israelis do during phase 1?**Answer:** Anything that can build trust, they will be forced to dismantle many settlements which will act as a great symbolic geature. I suggest pouring funds into media (movies & tv shows) that have characters speaking both arabic and hebrew showing coexistence. Ensuring their education system does not teach hate of Arabs.
3. **Question:** What if in phase 1 a radical group of Palestinians carry out many terrorist attacks, wont they end up with no land?**Answer:** Phase 1 has special rules, should a radical group gather too much momentum and carry out too much violence Phase 1 will be paused and or reset. The goal of phase 1 is to get through a period of time where new and decent education can kick in, economic opportunity can materialise and trust can build between both sides. If violence breaks out the police force will have to be beefed up (help from UAE and Saudi), arrests will be made and so on. This will continue until we can successfully pass phase 1. If we cannot pass phase 1 not much changes anyway. But there will be an important distinction between now and then, there will be a clear path available to walk down to achieve peace and prosperity.

Here is the facebook page for the Ryerson University chapter of the organization ""Students for Justice in Palestine"". 

As we can see, there's a cadre of dedicated pro-Israel ""activists"" (anti-Palestinian denialists and proud 'JDL' supporters amongst them) who spend all their time shit-posting on everything the group members post, or lying, or dehumanizing the Palestinians and those who stand up for them.

Accusations of 'antisemitism', of being 'agents of Hamas', personal attacks, insults, insults, and more insults. 

Shameless cheering over each and every Palestinian killed at the hands of Israelis. 

https://www.facebook.com/RyersonIsrael/?ref=py_c

On the other side of the scales, here is the Ryerson chapter of ""students supporting Israel"" facebook page. 

It's typically a hasbarist affair, as can only be expected. A lot of circlejerking, attempts to pretend that Israel ""is the real victim"", claims that the IDF is the ""most moral army"" and that the Palestinians are ""anti-Semitic terrorists"" or ""don't exist"" and so on...

Know what's missing?

Shit-posts. Trolling. Racist or dehumanizing slander. 

Seems like it's only the pastime of pro-Israel ""activists"" on the internet to do that sort of thing, to spew that kind of poison.

That means that objectively, if one can make a broader assumption from this specific microcosm, we're better people then they are.

173hkwh,For all our heart,"Imagine someone came to your home and said ""your home looks nice, I'm taking it. Also, we have an army SO we are taking it. If you have a problem the house will be destroyed with all your belongings ""

Now, you leave due to guns in your face and a gang at your door with your children crying instead of being in bed asleep.

Now, you peacefully leave.

You ask them ""why/what/how is this going on?""

Then some other family who looks like yours moves in front of you and you're left being told to move to somewhere in a desert with water access.

Don't worry, after you move the occupation will turn off your water once they have already claimed your neighbours home as their own.

That is what the occupier (Israel) has been doing day by day, hour by hour, street by street, for the last 75 years.

Now everyone is left in the tiniest corner of the room and the occupier is still coming for their space. So naturally, when your back is against a way, you push forward.

I saw a video of a Palestinian child being used as a weapon to push back Palestinians from praying.

If the shoe was on the other foot, Israel would be helped and Palestine would be condemned, but why is Palestine condemned when Israel is the oppressor.

I hope the generations after us will never see, feel or understand the hate some people carry right now.

Unfortunately, the road ahead of us needs to be built by every single one of us who knows you're looked down for a reason you cannot control. Once we're together, I am sure, that love will prevail.

1977ekc,What everyone wants from the Israel-Hamas war,"**Israel:** Israel has 3 objectives. Dismantling Hamas, securing the 100+ hostages that remain in Gaza and eliminating Mohammed Deif and Yahya Sinwar. Successfully dismantling Hamas will prove extremely difficult as it is deeply entrenched in Gaza and these kinds of lofty operations have failed in the past. Nonetheless, time will tell.

**Hamas:** It is a fair bet to say that Hamas probably wants a ceasefire by now. They've achieved a number of strategic and tactical goals that have changed the game of the 75 year Israel-Palestinian conflict and now would want international pressure to pile on Israel to start a ceasefire or more realistically, a scale back of its efforts before actual major damage is dealt to the group.

**Iran:** Iran has relished in the diplomatic victory it has achieved: setting back the Saudi-Israel normalization deal, which would see these 2 primary enemies of Iran team up to challenge its influence in the region. Its ongoing goal is to both project power in the Middle East and intimidate enemies but also not cross the threshold into a wider regional war, because then it would lose some of these assets. Also, recent reports indicate that their nuclear program is on steroids and they are rapidly but quietly enriching uranium as the war progresses

**Saudi Arabia:** Saudi Arabia wants to see first and foremost the war ended, but now it is likely to demand more for the Saudi recognition of Israel that was about to happen pre-October 7. If it were to normalize this year (which is unlikely), then Arabs around the region would loathe them for normalizing. In lieu of this, they might demand another high-profile Oslo-style agreement that sees a concrete pathway to a Palestinian state before normalizing.

**Palestinian Authority:** The PA wants Hamas to be disposed of in Gaza. Israel, despite searching for alternative options, will not find any beyond the authority that already operates in the West Bank. They will probably agree to governing Gaza, but only if there is a deal that leads to a Palestinian state. Right now, they are partially focused on calming their population and preventing a Third Intifada, which would undermine their credibility and call into question their capacity to govern.

**Netanyahu:** The current PM seeks a widening of the conflict because all the corruption charges, trials and endless protests he was subjected to before October 7 were put in hold. And they will resume the moment the Israeli public recognizes a switch from conflict to occupation, ousting him. A war with Hezbollah would be disruptive and get people to loathe him even more, but him sparking a Third Intifada in the West Bank would both protract the conflict (keeping him in power) but also undermine the PA and be able to portray the Palestinian government as weak and inept. He also has an ideological aim to portray the Palestinians as incapable of governing themselves, so more unrest would give him an excuse to expand settlements.

**Hezbollah:** They do not want another war with Israel, especially in the context of heightened tensions. They remain a formidable force but would rather engage in an indirect war or one of attrition, rather than full-scale, which would diminish their military capabilities.

**United States:** Under the Biden Administration, the US wants to see an end to the conflict and the weakening of Hamas - setting the stage for the PA to take power. At least, this is the US' public face. It has continued to support Israel even as thousands of Palestinians die, but it is a safe bet to assume that them ensuring a state is a good look.",SessionGloomy,2024-01-15,0,0.43,47,-1

2s9bs9,What did the Gaza war accomplish?,"Over 2000 people killed (including 500 children). And for what? What has changed? What has been gained? The Gazan people are even worse off than they were before. 

Palies want the blockade to end in Gaza, for the wall to be taken down separating West Bank and Israel, and for the lives of Palies in general to improve. Imagine tomorrow the Israeli leader agrees to all of the Palestinian demands. It would be immediately followed by suicide bombings, and attacks from Gaza. That politician and their party would never be re-elected again, and Israelis would be doubly determined to never give into Pali demands ever. Why would Israel do something that completely goes against their interest? Because right now that's what Palies are asking.

The Path to a Palestinian state is through Israel. Why can't you see this? Israel is not an inherently evil nation of evil people who rub their hands every night thinking of ways to hurt Palestinians. If Palies had used non-violent protesting, and had the position that they can assure Israel's safety and security, while only wanting the lives of the palestinian people to improve, this entire conflict could have been resolved decades ago. 

But no, Palestinians have to wage endless Jihad and martyrdom. There's a time and a place for armed insurrection, but it sure is not now. It only ends up hurting the people and continuing a cycle of violence. 

Israel may seem strong, but they're scared. The people and the government have an existential fear that their state may end one day. They are surrounded by states that are hostile to them. They sit beside Palestinians who are hostile to them. They need nuclear weapons to ensure that they are not destroyed through war. If you feed into this fear, you only make Israel more scared, and more hostile. They over react to every attack and use disproportionate force because they are scared of looking weak. Any sign of weakness, in their minds, is an opening and could lead to greater conflict. 

So why feed into this fear? Defuse the situation and try to be partners with Israel. Say ""We do not mean you harm. We only want the lives of our citizens to improve"". They might listen. Israelis are supporting hard-liners not because they're evil, but because they're filled with fear. There's a core of religious zealots, but many Israelis are secular and can be won over. But you need the right message, and endless suicide bombings is not the answer. 

Does anyone really think that a suicide bombing in some night club is going to achieve anything? Does anyone think that the families of the victims are going to think to themselves ""I guess I was wrong. I should support Palestinians and their rights"". Of course not. Their hearts are just going to be filled with that much more hate. 

Islam's love of Jihad and martyrdom is certainly a large part of the reason why the conflict is still on-going. Jihad has never worked or brought anything to Muslims all over the world other than pain and suffering. It results in these endless Jihadist insurgencies that achieve nothing and kill thousands of people. But it becomes part of their religion to fight, so it doesn't matter if nothing is achieved. They died as ""martyrs"" and thus get a free ticket to heaven. 

And this absolutely needs to be said: Both Islam and Judaism are man made religions. Bronze Age Nomads or 7th Arabian war lords did not have it all figured out. There's no evidence they had any direct line to God. The texts are written by people are merely express the views of the authors. There is zero external evidence that any of the supernatural claims of these holy texts are in any way factual. 

The path forward, for Palestinians and all Muslims is secularism and embrace of liberal values. The success of Jewish people previously in Europe and America was in part due to their embrace of secularism and education. Secular Jews contributed to art, science and society. Ultra-Orthodox Jews live in poverty, have little economic power, and contribute next to nothing to greater society. They just study religion all day and live in their little closed off communities. They and other ultra-religious groups are not a model that other societies should embrace. Secular Jews, Europeans and other developed nations are a model to embrace. Nations like Turkey or Tunisia are models to embrace. Neither are perfect. Far from it, but their relative secularization has led to their success. Tunisia has just become a democracy and might make it work. The first in NA. Turkey is the 15th biggest economy in the world. 

A secular liberal-democratic protest movement representing the Palestinians would solve this crisis. They would have solved it years ago. There is zero rational reason why Israelis and Palestinians can't live together. There is the Jewish and Islamic religions, which if you embrace would mean they can't live together. This is why I argue that the path forward is secularization. If you really believe the tenants of your faith, you are much more likely to be sectarian. 

This conflict is incredibly polarized. Just look at both this and the Israel subreddit, and you'll see that both sides are functioning on completely different narratives. I'm going to be accused of being a ""Zionist"" because as we know there are only two sides to any discussion. I'm not, Israel was a complete mistake. It was a ridiculous attempt to force the recreation of a state that hadn't existed for thousands of years. Complete mistake. For one, Arabs were simply not ready to ever accept Jewish neighbors. Jews should have moved to America, which is a much more hospitable environment for them. No wars, no conflict. And not a single Jew or Palestinian would have died. But it's too late now. We're stuck with Israel and have to deal with it. 

And this also needs to be said: if Israel didn't exist, the Middle-East would mostly be exactly the same as it is now. There would be tens of thousands of more Palestinians, and they would probably live at the same quality of life as Jordan now. But outside of that, no difference. MENA would still be completely backwards. 

This is a straight up rant because I am sick of this. I thought in high school that this conflict would long be solve. But it's the same unending cycle of violence with nothing achieved. I am sick of seeing dead Gazans. I'm sick of seeing Palestinians living in poverty and ruins. I'm sick of these Middle-Eastern wars. Prove to me that you're better than this. Prove to me that you really want to see change and do not want to see the same cycle repeat until the end of time. There should be no more Gazan wars. No more suicide bombings. No more rockets. No more assassinations. I genuinely love the Israeli and Palestinian people, which is why this angers me so much.",,2015-01-13,6,0.56,14,-1

**Boycott Israel everyone!**

Bombs are falling all around,
Children dying, what have they done?
What’s the reason? They don’t understand it.
Boycott Israel, everyone!

Time for blocking any information
People in darkness all night long
Time for bleeding
And endless amputations
Time for singing protest songs

We're gonna have a bombing tonight
We gonna find a child underneath the rubble pile
Operate by candlelight

Buildings swaying, people praying,
Young and old ones, shake with fear.
All they wish is that every day was peaceful
And occupation would disappear

We're gonna have a bombing tonight
Snipers are pointing guns at people who are dispossessed 
But never give up the fight

Bombs are falling all around,
We’ll be saying, what have we done?
What’s the reason? No-one understands it.
Boycott Israel, everyone!


**Do they know it’s Christmas?**

It’s Christmas time, and we need to be afraid.
At Christmas time, they let in tanks and they banish aid.
And in our world of plenty, we pretend it’s self-defence.
Ship our arms around the world to Palestine.

But say a prayer; pray for the orphans.
At this sad time, it’s hard to have any fun.

There’s a world outside your window,
And it’s a world of dread and fear.
Where the only water flowing is controlled by Israel.

And the medicine has run out,
And the food has run out too.

Well, tonight thank God it’s them instead of you.

And there won’t be peace
Without justice in Palestine.
The greatest gift they’ll get this year is life.
Stop bombing all their homes.
It’s time for us to show
That we won’t accept this genocide at all.

MK-eight two
Smashing glass on everyone.
Whole families
Underneath that hot rubble.
We won’t accept this genocide at all.
Free the world!
Let them know that Palestine is here…


**It’s beginning to look a lot like genocide**

It’s beginning to look a lot like genocide,
Everywhere you go.
Take a look at TikTok again,
And sharing on Instagram,
With fighter planes and missile strikes that glow.

It’s beginning to look a lot like genocide,
Tents in every school,
But the sorriest sight to see,
Is the baby that will be,
Hurt by a world so cruel.

The end of evil pogroms and some peace in the land,
Was the wish of woman and man.
Freedom to talk and go for a walk,
And the hope was never again.
But Britain and United States have vetoed the UN.

It’s beginning to look a lot like genocide,
There’s nowhere safe at all.
There’s a tank and a mortar shell,
And a bomb in the park as well,
The guided kind they drop on hospitals.

It’s beginning to look a lot like genocide,
Soon the bombs will start,
And the thing that will make them end,
Is coming together as friends,
With a sincere heart.


**O Little Town of Bethlehem**

O little town of Bethlehem,
Still under apartheid.
About thy occupation though,
Only silence and lies.
Yet in the dark streets shineth,
The everlasting light,
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.

When morning comes in Gaza,
The children cry from thirst.
They look for food and find nothing,
And plead to men on Earth.
For children born in Gaza,
Are slaughtered every day,
While leaders sleep, the angels keep
On listening to us pray.

How silently, how silently,
We go about our lives.
We listen to the BBC
And question not the lies. 
No ear will hear them pleading,
But in this world of sin,
Some meek souls will not rest until
The aid has entered in.


**Violent Night**

Violent night, Gaza’s plight.
All is dark, out of sight.
Bomb civilian mother and child.
Starve the infants, in graves they are piled.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Violent night, all war crimes.
We will quake at the sight.
Send them aid from near and far, 
We demand a ceasefire.
Time to shout enough!
Time to shout enough!

Silent night, Palestine.
Land of God, shining bright.
Soon be granted justice and peace.
Your oppression must falter and cease.
Let your people be free.
Let your people be free.",zenplantman,2023-12-23,9,0.6,4,-1

Then we both get the media.

We get a wrong view of each other.

6ti4az,If Palestine had a proper resistance movement...,"... such as they did back in the 70's but in today. A secular antizionist movement. Do you think they would accept volunteers helping to fight for Palestine and against Israel, like if I as a Swede or someone from another country could volunteer and become a soldier? Would Syria help this resistance movement just like the USSR and China supported the PFPL? 

Let's say this movements goal was to reclaim all of Palestine and every part that Israel stole and reclaim it. Do you think Russia would support it and somehow cause a trouble for the IDF? How long would the process take to reclaim all stolen land? It sure would be one/few against everyone but I think of the quote by Mao Tse Tung if I recall it right that the enemy is just a paper tiger inside.

Any pros and cons? Personally I think there is no other way to reclaim the stolen land, the Israelis can either accept that the government is now Palestinian or move to their parents and grandparents homecountry. Look at how people talk, talk and talk and nothing happens.

Barack Obama’s statement:

“Thoughts on Israel and Gaza Barack Obama

     It’s been 17 days since Hamas launched its horrific attack against Israel, killing over 1,400 Israeli citizens, including defenseless women, children and the elderly. In the aftermath of such unspeakable brutality, the U.S. government and the American people have shared in the grief of families, prayed for the return of loved ones, and rightly declared solidarity with the Israeli people.
As I stated in an earlier post, Israel has a right to defend its citizens against such wanton violence, and I fully support President Biden’s call for the United States to support our long-time ally in going after Hamas, dismantling its military capabilities, and facilitating the safe return of hundreds of hostages to their families.

 But even as we support Israel, we should also be clear that how Israel prosecutes this fight against Hamas matters. In particular, it matters — as President Biden has repeatedly emphasized — that Israel’s military strategy abides by international law, including those laws that seek to avoid, to every extent possible, the death or suffering of civilian populations. Upholding these values is important for its own sake — because it is morally just and reflects our belief in the inherent value of every human life. Upholding these values is also vital for building alliances and shaping international opinion — all of which are critical for Israel’s long-term security.
This is an enormously difficult task. War is always tragic, and even the most carefully planned military operations often put civilians at risk. As President Biden noted during his recent visit to Israel, America itself has at times fallen short of our higher values when engaged in war, and in the aftermath of 9/11, the U.S. government wasn’t interested in heeding the advice of even our allies when it came to the steps we took to protect ourselves against Al Qaeda. Now, after the systematic massacre of Israeli citizens, a massacre that evokes some of the darkest memories of persecution against the Jewish people, it’s understandable that many Israelis have demanded that their government do whatever it takes to root out Hamas and make sure such attacks never happen again. Moreover, Hamas’ military operations are deeply embedded within Gaza — and its leadership seems to intentionally hide among civilians, thereby endangering the very people they claim to represent.
Still, the world is watching closely as events in the region unfold, and any Israeli military strategy that ignores the human costs could ultimately backfire. Already, thousands of Palestinians have been killed in the bombing of Gaza, many of them children. Hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes. The Israeli government’s decision to cut off food, water and electricity to a captive civilian population threatens not only to worsen a growing humanitarian crisis; it could further harden Palestinian attitudes for generations, erode global support for Israel, play into the hands of Israel’s enemies, and undermine long term efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region.

 It’s therefore important that those of us supporting Israel in its time of need encourage a strategy that can incapacitate Hamas while minimizing further civilian casualties. Israel’s recent shift to allow relief trucks into Gaza, prompted in part by the Biden administration’s behind-the-scenes diplomacy, is an encouraging step, but we need to continue to lead the international community in accelerating critical aid and supplies to an increasingly desperate Gaza population. And while the prospects of future peace may seem more distant than ever, we should call on all of the key actors in the region to engage with those Palestinian leaders and organizations that recognize Israel’s right to exist to begin articulating a viable pathway for Palestinians to achieve their legitimate aspirations for self-determination — because that is the best and perhaps only way to achieve the lasting peace and security most Israeli and Palestinian families yearn for.
Finally, in dealing with what is an extraordinarily complex situation where so many people are in pain and passions are understandably running high, all of us need to do our best to put our best values, rather than our worst fears, on display.
That means actively opposing anti-semitism in all its forms, everywhere. It means rejecting efforts to minimize the terrible tragedy that the Israeli people have just endured, as well as the morally-bankrupt suggestion that any cause can somehow justify the deliberate slaughter of innocent people.
It means rejecting anti-Muslim, anti-Arab or anti-Palestinian sentiment. It means refusing to lump all Palestinians with Hamas or other terrorist groups. It means guarding against dehumanizing language towards the people of Gaza, or downplaying Palestinian suffering — whether in Gaza or the West Bank — as irrelevant or illegitimate.
It means recognizing that Israel has every right to exist; that the Jewish people have claim to a secure homeland where they have ancient historical roots; and that there

 have been instances in which previous Israeli governments made meaningful efforts to resolve the dispute and provide a path for a two-state solution — efforts that were ultimately rebuffed by the other side.
It means acknowledging that Palestinians have also lived in disputed territories for generations; that many of them were not only displaced when Israel was formed but continue to be forcibly displaced by a settler movement that too often has received tacit or explicit support from the Israeli government; that Palestinian leaders who’ve been willing to make concessions for a two-state solution have too often had little to show for their efforts; and that it is possible for people of good will to champion Palestinian rights and oppose certain Israeli government policies in the West Bank and Gaza without being anti-semitic.
Perhaps most of all, it means we should choose not to always assume the worst in those with whom we disagree. In an age of constant rancor, trolling and misinformation on social media, at a time when so many politicians and attention seekers see an advantage in shedding heat rather than light, it may be unrealistic to expect respectful dialogue on any issue — much less on an issue with such high stakes and after so much blood has been spilled. But if we care about keeping open the possibility of peace, security and dignity for future generations of Israeli and Palestinian children — as well as for our own children — then it falls upon all of us to at least make the effort to model, in our own words and actions, the kind of world we want them to inherit.”",Dry_Conversation8501,2023-10-24,2,0.54,19,0

I have a question for you, I've never liked defending Morocco or its politics but there is something that is dear and rooted in my heart and soul : The Sahara is Moroccan.   


I genuinely want to know, what do you think about it ? What is your stance on that subject. Did you support us before this normalization ? Do you still support our sovereignty over our Sahara and our legitimate rights to it ?

I've been seeing a lot of hate in many comments and this hate made me defend Morocco's decision which is, as I said, something I never did before. If you check my post history on the Moroccan sub, I even criticized publicly some aspects of my country (A few months ago).   


I don't understand why did my Country accept the normalization with Israël but what I don't understand even more is people downplaying our right to our land. I want to believe that the comments I read weren't honest and are angered reactions to the normalization.

175xj2o,I think there’s more to this I’m sure some might disagree but this seems like what’s going on to me & the questions worth asking. Who gains & who suffers,"Hamas is a pawn of Iran, and Iran is a pawn of Russia. This situation is primarily about a potential deal with the Saudis. As long as Israel suppresses Palestine, and America supports this suppression, the United States loses legitimacy and influence in the eyes of a large portion of the world. A deal was impending with the Saudis, which could have exerted political pressure on Israel to grant more rights to the Palestinians. Do you really believe that the IRGC in Iran thinks that Hamas, with its rockets and guns, could defeat Israel? Hamas consists of angry young men who have been deceived into believing they are defending their people. In reality, they are just pawns, providing Israel with an excuse to oppress the Palestinians without global intervention.

Now, Biden has given 6 billion to Iran in exchange for some prisoners, while a deal with the Saudis that could pave the way for normalizing Israel's relations with more Middle Eastern countries, was on the horizon. This would inherently require Israel to change its treatment of the Palestinians, adding pressure to halt settlements and potentially paving a path towards a two-state solution – a solution Biden has supported.

So, why does Hamas choose to attack now? Who truly suffers from this and who stands to gain the most? It's like a game of thrones. How can America defend Ukraine when Israel, under Benjamin Netanyahu, appears to be even more aggressive towards civilians than Putin is in Ukraine? The moment these events unfolded, I began expressing my solidarity with the civilians. It was evident that Israel would retaliate on a grand scale, without necessarily enhancing their security. This horrendous act of terror from Hamas took place under Netanyahu's far-right government, which has intensified the oppression of the Palestinians, all under the guise of national security. And why now, especially during an election year for America? Who stands to benefit from a global surge in anti-American sentiments and antisemitism, which Israel's predictable response to these attacks could foster? 🤷🏻‍♂️",Sonic_Improv,2023-10-12,4,0.56,7,1

How do you see this bloody conflict will end? How do you hope it'll end? Do you believe in the two-states solution? Or maybe you think that there'll be some sort of confederation between a Jewish and a Palestinian state? Or you believe in a non-nation secular state whose citizens will be treated in a really just and democratic way? Or maybe you believe in a Palestinian state from the River to the Sea with kind of a Jewish autonomy somewhere?

Also, I'm interested in your view on the Palestinian refugees' matter. Do you think they'll return to this land? Or they'll get financial compensation? Or maybe there'll be a Right for Return, but not many will use it?

Thank you for the answers. I only ask for two things:

1. Please share your REAL opinion. If you believe in the two-states solution, please mention it. If you think that the only solution is a war victory followed by ethnic cleansing, please mention it. I didn't come here to sell you Hasbara, neither I came to make a discussion nor to persuade you in something. I only came here for the opinions of Palestinians, because I have no other place for it. Unfortunately, I don't understand the Arabic language, so I can't read Palestinian views on Facebook.
2. Please, be civil and don't be racist or Antisemitic. I know, most of you are mad at us, and especially at our government, its policies, and the settlers. But I didn't come for war. I am a private individual who just wants to hear Palestinians' opinions, that's all.

edit: I've seen some very angry opinions here. I assume nothing, ok? I don't assume people will be racist in the comments, but I suppose maybe *someone* can be this way. And I understand this, you know? I'm not racist, but because this conflict is so desperate, I can see many people will be angry and not polite.

When you talk of ethnicity, it may encourage ""love"" but never permanently & no compulsive morality. Then there are regional difference among single ethnicities which can lead to further divide.

The Middle East was united not too long ago on religion, & religion enforced morality & morality enforced the fear of betraying your brethren. The people of Khwarizm got along without any problem for centuries but then Russia stoked the fire of ethnicity over religion leading to infighting & the states are now incredibly poor & dependant on Russia & China. The measuring-ruler-defined Thisstans & Thatstans didn't exist & are simply products of evil ideology that is communism.

IMO *Pan Arabism was ploy by the Westerners* to weaken & separate the remaining middle East. They did more damage than anyone. It's killing two birds with one stone: ending the only & single largest threat to West aka Khilafah & making way for unquestionable blantant plunder & destruction of the rich lands for the coming centuries since colonialism was become unsustainable.

& Irl the Peninsular Arabs have been in league with Zionists for quite some time, only now their coming out of the closet. Their Najdi ideology only cares about riches. More will want a piece of that cake openly soon.

Can't describe how much I'd love for leaders of Palestine, Yemen, Syria, Libya & everyone suffering & actual sympathisers to form a coalition. Lot of NATO's & what not. Maybe it will not work but at least won't mean keeping expectations with hypocrites & lipservicemen.

 You may say that Israel need to end this war and this occupation, and let's say id dose, how can Israel know it's citizens are safe ?

Even on days of silence, missiles from Gaza and shootings (like the one in Tel Aviv)  kept coming. What do you expect Israel to do?

2mttz1,Palestine. (This article was inspired),"I’m going to tell you the tale of hundreds of thousands of people, who in 1948 were kicked out of their homes, whose families were murdered, and for those still alive, who were forced out of their own country.  They left to immigrate to neighboring Arab countries for shelter. This is the tale of the Palestinians. The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict has been going on for decades only to be re-ignited for various dumb reasons at the expense of thousands of innocent lives on both sides.

Just saying the word Palestine angers some. People will tell me to my face that there has never been and will never be a Palestine, and there are no such thing as Palestinians. To them, I guess Palestinians simply aren't people. So what does that make me? 

For me, the possibility that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would have never happened, and what would have been, lingers in my thoughts quite often. I Imagine what would have been if my family was still living in Palestine, and I was born in the West Bank instead of New York. Would have I gone to school? Would my parents have met? Would I even be alive? 

I’m going to try to explain what happened to you in the way the my father did, that this issue is a civil rights problem. The fallacy that european zionists often repeated at the time was that Palestine was “a land without people, for a people without land.” Well… this turned out to be inaccurate as at the time there were more than 600,000 people living in Palestine.

The Zionists, had a vision to create a Jewish homeland in Palestine for all the Jews scattered around the world. However, Palestine already had people of several other religions such as Arab muslims and christians living there. To understand why this is a problem, imagine saying that the United States is a Christian state and everyone who was of a different religion would be either kicked out or become essentially a second class citizen. We would now find this to be completely and utterly racist. The reason Palestinians and Israelis are fighting, contrary to popular belief, is because of land, not because Jews hate Palestinians or vise versa. Whenever the Arabs, or more specifically the Palestinians engage in a renewed episode of war, the excuse that the Israelis always use is that they are a tiny, little country protecting themselves as they are surrounded by Arab nations.  Note that this conflict is really between the Israelis and Palestinians, not between them and the Arabs.  The Israelis say that they 5 million people compared to 300 millions Arabs, while this is true, the Arabs aren't the people they are fighting against, the Palestinians. The population of the Israelis and Palestinians is comparable with the latter standing at 6 million.

Though the two sides are comparable in size, the Israelis have one of the strongest militaries in the world, which dwarfs any military power the Palestinians might have. Israel continues to refuse to acknowledge Palestine’s right to exist, which in turn is the root cause for this ongoing problem, that will only most likely result in future bloody affairs and not peace. I want you to understand from reading this article that what the Israelis did, going to my people’s homeland, taking it over rather than sharing it, and kicking them out is a violation of our civil rights and is just outright inhumane.

17do4qc,AMERICANS-- please SIGN and SHARE this petition to have Secretary of State Blinken SUSPENDED for enabling a genocide,"Hi all,

Secretary of State Blinken has disastrously betrayed the responsibility he owes the American people. He is using taxpayer funds to funnel weapons to a genocidal regime. He has turned the United States into a mockery on the international stage. **We are losing talented officials through his incompetence and inhumane policies.** 

[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/state-department-resignation-gaza\_n\_65306079e4b00565b622b1fb](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/state-department-resignation-gaza_n_65306079e4b00565b622b1fb)

The United States is **NOT** a colony of Israel; when we pay taxes, the Secretary of State has a moral and legal obligation to use those taxes in an ethical manner that is beneficial to the people of America. 

**Enough is enough**. We do not want to be a part of a genocide, and he has no right to force us into such a position.

Please sign and share this petition, and call your representatives to have then condemn his disastrous leadership before he succeeds.

oofkzq,Why would Hamas or the Palestinian Authority agree to a one-state solution?,"Most people who support a one-state solution believe that Israel would be the most difficult party to bring to the table. I actually think Hamas and the PA would be less interested in it. A one-state solution would require the leaders of Hamas and the Palestinian Authority to give up their power, and I do not see that happening, regardless of how much pressure the international community puts on Israel. People often compare the Israel-Palestine conflict to South Africa. However, South Africa was 90% black during Apartheid, and the African National Congress — the largest South African anti-Apartheid party/movement — simply became the government once Apartheid had ended. However, in the case of the Palestinians, there are three Arab factions: Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, and the Arabs who live in Israel proper. Neither Hamas nor the PA could expect to remain in power if one state were created; in fact, they would both expect to lose their power. The corruption of both Hamas and the PA are well documented, and the leaders of each have abused their power in order to enrich themselves. Heck, Mahmoud Abbas still refuses to hold elections because he is afraid of losing, so why would he be willing to give up all his power in the case of a one-state solution? And if the one-state solution is his ""secret weapon,"" why hasn't he ever brought it up? Hamas has complete control over the Gaza strip, so why would they give that up? Ultimately, how could a one-state solution come into being if the parties that would have to agree to it are corrupt, and would be forced to surrender their power?",ottolouis,2021-07-21,2,0.55,3,1

Earlier today (Oct 18) before President Biden departed Israel, he and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu held a press conference.

The Whitehouse provided a transcript, which is here \[[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/18/remarks-by-president-biden-and-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel-before-bilateral-meeting-tel-aviv-israel/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/18/remarks-by-president-biden-and-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel-before-bilateral-meeting-tel-aviv-israel/)\]([https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/18/remarks-by-president-biden-and-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel-before-bilateral-meeting-tel-aviv-israel/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/10/18/remarks-by-president-biden-and-prime-minister-netanyahu-of-israel-before-bilateral-meeting-tel-aviv-israel/))

In his remarks, Netanyahu cited the 1400 Israeli dead on the awful day of October 7, at the hands of the Hamas who staged the ""incursion"" into Israel.I was struck by Netanyahu's rhetorical construct, in which he compared the number of Israeli dead to Israel's population, and then applied that metric to the US to tell the cameras it would be like someone had suddenly killed 50,000 Americans.

OMG... that's about 2x the city I live in!!

But then I wondered how many Americans would be dead if we were being killed at the same rate as Palestinians in Gaza..... YIKES it comes out to about 12 dead in Gaza for 1 dead in Israel... not counting the soon-to-be dead or the missing. (The source for Gaza dead in the accompanying graphic was the Associated Press, found here \[[https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-biden-hospital-d9606e0ead1f8c4e9fd00b602ed14a38](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-biden-hospital-d9606e0ead1f8c4e9fd00b602ed14a38)\]([https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-biden-hospital-d9606e0ead1f8c4e9fd00b602ed14a38](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-hamas-war-biden-hospital-d9606e0ead1f8c4e9fd00b602ed14a38))

14ax57i,دولة ديمقراطية واحدة، لا دولة مع المستوطنين!," إن طرح الدولة الديمقراطية الواحدة يعلن الحرب على المشروع الصهيوني بخطاب  جديد، مرتديًا ثوبه الثوري والإنساني. ويعود بالقضية الفلسطينية إلى جذورها  ويضخ دماء جديدة في شرايين أبناءها وبناتها. أمام مشاريع قزمت القضية  وجعلتها صراعًا على حدود، أو نضالًا من أجل مواطنة كاملة وحقوق متساوية، أو  التشكي من سلوك حكومة يمينية متطرفة قد تتغير في أي عملية انتخابية مقبلة،  يعيد طرح الدولة الديمقراطية الواحدة السؤال حول شرعية قيام دولة إسرائيل،  التي قدمت نفسها وما تزال بأن قيامها جاء من منطلق ""عدالة التاريخ للشعب  اليهودي المقهور"" وتحاول أن تقنع نفسها، وتقنع العالم معها، أن قيامها كان  طبيعيًا وفي ظروف طبيعية، لا على أساس جريمة تطهير عرقي بحق شعب كامل. ان  الاعتراف بشرعية الدولة اليهودية هو إقرار بهذا المنطق، الذي يكذبه التاريخ  والجغرافيا. 

أن طرح الدولة الديمقراطية الواحدة  يرتكز على رفض الاعتراف بدولة يهودية  في فلسطين بما هي دولة تقوم على بناء دولة خصوصية يكون فيها التفوق  والغلبة  لليهود حصرًا دون غيرهم، ونؤكد رفضنا لذلك المنطق القائل بأن يهود  العالم يشكلون شعبًا أو قومية واحدة، وهو أساس الفكر الصهيوني العنصري.  طرح المشروع الفلسطيني لإقامة الدولة الديمقراطية الواحدة يدعو لبناء دولة  القانون الديمقراطية، ولبناء المجتمع الفلسطيني الجديد القادر على تجاوز  صدمات الماضي. ولسوف يعمل هذا المشروع على توفير كافة الشروط الملائمة لكي  تستطيع هاتين الكتلتين الديمغرافيتين اللتين ستعيشان في فلسطين التاريخية  على ممارسة حياة طبيعية قائمة على مبادئ العدالة بعد استعادة كافة الحقوق  الوطنية لشعب فلسطين كمقدمة للعيش في ظل قوانين المواطنة المتساوية دون أي  اعتبارات تمييزية قد ترتكز على الانتماءات الدينية أو الإثنية أو اللغوية  أو الجنسية.

Now I want to hear the other side of the story, but I'm having trouble finding out how. Would you have any sources that tell me what the motives of the invading Arab nations were and how Palestinians were caught in the middle of this mess?

A source describing the creation of Israel in Palestinian territory would be helpful too.

2d3730,A simple analogy which exposes Israel,"In recent weeks, commentators have looked for an effective means of exposing Israel’s misconduct. As I am about to show, there are a number of simple analogies which encapsulate the unacceptable nature of Israel’s “strategy”. 

Due to the mandate they gained in 2006, Hamas are the ruling party in Gaza. Of the 10 constituencies in Gaza, Hamas achieved 64% of the seats available. As a result of Hamas gaining democratic authority in Gaza, Israel feels it is justified in attacking Gaza (for the actions of *Hamas*).

Irrespective of Hamas missile-fire having no drastic effect on Israeli society, how can you punish civilians for the conduct of an elected government? Moreover, how can you punish civilians for the conduct of an unofficial “Army”?

In relation to the latter question, consider the conflict which existed between the Provisional IRA and British government. Between 1979 and 1999, the PIRA launched various attacks on mainland Britain. As irate as the British government would have been, they could never have acted in the vein of Israel. If British decided to incessantly bomb West Belfast, Derry, South Armagh and East Tyrone (areas where the PIRA were particularly strong); the international community would have been outraged. 

But because the Palestinians have astronomically less influence in the western world than the Irish; they have no source of such outcry. 

In 1997 and 2001, Tony Blair’s Labour Party achieved 63% of seats available in Westminster. In other words, and on two separate occasions, they achieved a strikingly similar mandate to Hamas in Gaza. 

In 2001, Tony Blair deployed the British Army to  Afghanistan. In 2003, Tony Blair deployed the British Army to Iraq. 

In response to Britain’s involvement in the Middle East, Islamist groups have targeted Britain. In the instance of the 7/7 Bombings, Islamists attacked central London. They attacked central London because of the British government’s involvement in the Middle East. In an act of pseudo-retribution, they killed British citizens for the actions of the British government. 

Much like 9/11 – where the analogy is exactly the same - the western world was repulsed by the notion that an entire population should be attacked for the actions of a government. When you recklessly endanger civilians for the actions of an authority, you are engaging in terrorism. 

By treating the Gazan people like a fly on the window, Israel usher the Gazan people into the influence of extremism. Much like the perpetrators of 7/7 and 9/11, Israel are acting without humanity. They cannot continue viewing the Gazan people in such sub-human terms.

However since these Attacks by Hamas earlier this month Israel has come down especially hard. (To hard if you ask me)

But Israel were attacked by hamas and it wasn’t an attack on military locations.

I just feel like this is kicking the hornets nest. It’s like hamas has just used Palestine as a tool to get Muslims all of the world to want to Destroy Israel.

If I had it my way Israel should never have been a thing in the first place but sadly it is and with American support it’s here to stay…

I also want some strong ones I can maybe show my father to open him up since he is so close minded; He claims that since the Palestinian settlers who were here before weren't really organized, it was alright for us to take Israel and organize it and that if they argue that they were there first then we were even before them.

Recently my dad has been even more extreme, claiming we should just nuke a village every time there is an act of terrorism to show them that their actions have consequences because now if they commit a crime they will just go to a jail that is probably even more habitable than their home so it's more of a reward than a punishment.

Just for the antisemitic people here, most israeli people are a lot less extreme and most tend to want peace (at least from what I've seen)

157apmm,A Moroccan's simple questions about Palestine and its war for independence.,"Good day Palestinian friends, I'm Moroccan, and as you might know there is a debate going about Morocco answering Israel's calls for relation naturalization.  

I have some questions about this specific matter, and other general questions too.  Thank you in advance for reading and answering.   

###1
mohammed VI is the chairperson of Al Quds Committee (وكالة بيت مال القدس). Morocco tries to fund this committee legally by giving stipends to Palestinian students, and by funding Palestinian small and medium businesses.  

Was this fundraising done by Morocco ever felt or discussed by the general Palestinian population whether in all the territories they hold ?   

______

###2
 How do you deal with a growing fact that Palestinian is unlikely to get its borders pre-colonization, and that Israel cannot and will not cease to exist anytime soon ?  

I have heard the popular arguments about Arabs under the ottoman caliphate or Algerians under french rule. But your case is specific, since the land is small, the Israeli lobby stretches out to all global superpowers except China.   

Israelis are very motivated to stay both religiously, ethnically, culturally and historically, unlike the french in Algeria who were tied only economically to the agricultural lands and to the monetary benefits from the colonial institutions.  

_____

###3
What is a realistic plan you are seeing on the long term ?  

I want you to know that keeping the status quo is also a plan, even it is disadvantageous to the Palestinians on all levels.   This was the case for Morocco's when Spain took Ceuta and Melilla after their reconquista - Moroccans (especially the Berbers who happen to live around the two enclaves) have traded and entered them for work, but at another times they have sieged them in the hope of gaining something, this trend lasted centuries because they have never recognized they rule over the enclaves.  

In Palestine's case, you cannot do this, because unlike Ceuta and Melilla, Israel would want to expand into the west bank and is actively settling the countryside and trying to look for people to kick out of their homes by exploiting legal loopholes.

This means no more  collaboration, no more obeying any orders. no more  paying taxes,no more using the shekel and fill the israeli prisons with men women and the children...
Overflow the checkpoints, ignore every rule,law,signpost and swarm over the settlements.and walk into the homes that are there illegally.  Dive and jump into the settlements swimming pools. Divert the water back into Palestinian farms and fields where they belong.  Plant a million olive trees where so many have been uprooted and destroyed by the occupation.   
Walk, run,ride,drive, hobble west, north, south and east...Swim in the jordan...Go the dead sea and enjoy a swim.Tear down the apartheid wall,every brick until its nothing but dust...Break out from Gaza, Bethlehem,Ramallah and everywhere....
Walk, ramble,amble, shuffle,  wherever you are to be as a free human being in your own land.  F*** the occupation! 
Fill their prisons and jails until they are bursting...The third and final Intifada should and will be the last.  Like a rising Palestinian tide to sweep over the land from water to water will be the third intifada...
You want to be free? You are already free! You just have to practice and be what you're already are and do it. 
Find any israeli tank and fill its barrel with poop, dirt,rocks, anything.  Find all israeli military vehicles. Fill the gas tanks with your urine, with dirt,rocks anything....Disable every tool of violence.
Stand up,ignore every checkpoint, walk around, through, over, every fence,wall, and obstacle .  Swarm, swarm, swarm as a free Palestinian tide of humanity to Tel Aviv....
Thousands, tens of thousands,hundreds of thousands of Palestinians need to go to the doors of the Knesset then enter proudly ,defiantly, nonviolently and do an old-fashioned,effective sit-down, we will not leave strike until laws are enacted that formally free us all once  and for  all.  Bills that need to be passed that call for what should have been done in 1948: Unfettered, free elections for everyone!!! A reckoning, an emancipation, self-determination...Climaxing in atonement on the floor of the Knesset...Today! Not tomorrow, not at the UN, not in the usa, or oslo but here!
      And for those generations outside of the illusory,allusionary boundaries that they call the borders of israel let every Palestinian come forth to descend and come HOME! Bring our house keys because you're coming home after so long. Handala will finally unclasp his hands and we will see his face for the first time.  Home, home, home at last..!!! Egalitarianism!

The  article notes that ""it makes little sense to let fantastical visions  for the future obscure deeply embedded existing arrangements"" and  suggests that US policymakers should switch from talking about a  two-state proposal to embracing the one-state reality and working on a  transition to democracy, although it notes that such an arrangement is  not currently on the table. This includes  ""conditioning military and  economic aid to Israel on clear and specific measures to terminate  Israel’s military rule over the Palestinians"".

Finally,  it warns that although Israel has the military upper hand, ""control  requires more than brute strength, it also requires some semblance of  legitimacy ...

8rp51j,bit of a strange question,"im not israeli, not jewish, not palestinian, not arab. 

on 9 jan a hamas cell killed an insraeli. other events happened in between, but in response israel began searching for the cell and killed one palestinian. the hamas cell attack seems to be in response a palestinian killed on 4 jan. straight off wikipedia. facts may not be accurate but the basic idea is the tit for tat aspect.

so my question to you guys how you feel about the hamas attack first and the israeli response second. im not looking for the usual, factual type opinion. im looking for your gut feelings. do you support it? dont support it but see the rationale? dont support it at all? all options are of course ok and i respect all options. but i just need to know and if you could describe that, it would be great. forgive me for being tactless, i know im asking you to relive something bitter. 

to be clear, not looking for the ""usual"" opinion. this is for a story im writing, so im looking for your gut emotions. in general, i basically want to know how you feel when you send guys in. and if your opinion is lets say extreme, i of course perfectly respect that as well. you have the right to hold your opinion and i know i cant understand it because i havent been through what you guys have been. so i respect that. but the truth is what id love to hear.

The moderator of /r/Israel is a prominent poster in the subreddit. I have managed to successfully infiltrate the subreddit on an unspecified account, and I am currently monitoring all of their activities. There are pages of vote-brigading, primarily on /r/worldnews, and there is frequent talk about how too suppress criticism of Israel and blackball the more frequent critics.

I gained access to the sub fairly recently, but the other user had access for a longer period of time, and was instrumental in helping me gain access. There are other subs like this one out there which are dedicated to spreading Hasbara (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_diplomacy_(Israel)) and sowing discord where criticism of Israel occurs.

It is disgusting and something should be done about it. Perhaps spread the word and the screenshots I linked.

""By ""genocide"" we mean the destruction of an ethnic group…. Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.""",MrBoonio,2020-07-02,3,0.59,0,-1
gb0cn6,Palestine Will Never Be Free.. Until...,"You know when you’re watching a bunch of people doing the same thing over and over and over.... then all of a sudden you realize something?.. 


So, that’s what happens to me...


I was watching tiktok.. and I see a lot of brothers and sisters post up the Palestine flag and saying, “Free Palestine”...


And after so many times seeing that over and over and over.... It hit me.. 


I though... you know what... Palestine would never be Free.... 


Hold on... don’t get upset.... let me explain... continue reading...


First ask yourself.... when was the last time Palestine actually free??..


I’ll answer it for you... when the Ottoman Empire existed... around 1917 or so...


So how did we lose it?... We sold them out... 


so what does it mean?...


It means that If you want Palestine to actually be free... stop spreading fitnah... 


Which is you guessed it... nationalism.. 


So, Every time you see Muslim posting their countries and the little flags next to them... guess what.. that’s what got the ummah in the position it is in today... 


Palestine will never be free until the ummah becomes one and gets rid of nationalism... get rid of these flags brothers & sisters it just causes more fitnah...


Lastly, if you’re muslim... ask yourself... would our beloved prophet phub agree with nationalism today? With you having a different flag then me & so on?...


Allahu3alam... I maybe wrong.. but this is just my 2 cents. 


I hope I did not upset you. My intention is to share this thought with you. And what I believe is the cause of our ummah to be in this position in the first place. And if I did offend/upset you, I apologize in advance..

1811kya,Allegations of Rape By Hamas 7 Oct - What's your view?,"Hi, for context I am solidly in favour of the right to Palestinian liberation and self determination.

Evidence for large scale destruction and death in Gaza and continuing dispossession in the WB are undeniable. Collective punishment and genocide towards the Palestinians has so much evidence I'm boggled anyone thinks otherwise. 

I'm also aware of a great deal of fake evidence release by the IDF (fake nurse, planted laptop, beheaded babies, ""list of terrorists"", etc.) and very telling omissions by the Israeli government (IDF helicopters attacking own civilians on Oct 7, Israelis knowing about the al Shifa tunnel complex because THEY BUILT it, Israeli bolstering of hamas in the past, etc). And all of this creates a prudent skepticism of what stories Israel presents. 

However, I have noticed many people claiming ""no one was raped"" on Oct 7. And it may be partially because of my own trauma with sexual abuse, I feel as if the story does not discount the plausibility of rape happening. 

So evidence for the rape that happened seems to be:
1- testimonial from on lookers
2- forensic testimonial
3- speculation from videos
4- one mention of a video taken by a survivors where ""hamas disguised as idf was gang raping someone""
5- IDF published info of someone captured from hamas saying they were commanded to rape and pillage (I'd consider this weak evidence)

Common refutations I see are
6- the testimonial of good treatment from a released hostage
7- some examples of 7oct pictures or footage that have clearly been sourced elsewhere
8- alternative speculations on videos circulated
9- none of the rape victims are alive to testimony (weak - if you were close enough to get raped, you'd probably not escape death/capture)

I don't see enough evidence for the ""mass rape"" claim.
But I don't think I can refute that rape by select individuals in hamas happened, based on the following:

9- I don't expect homogeneity in the morals of people under banner of any organisation. It's plausible those taking care of the hostages and some partaking in the raid don't have the same moral standards. No community is completely free of misogyny.
10 - Events of conflict and aggression seem like common catalysts for the perpetuation of sexual violence amongst ALL people. Hell, I was reading about an American soldier going into a rage back in the Vietnam war after his unit was killed and raping a girl after he slaughtered her village (source: the body keeps the score)
11- People can misuse some out of context or weak hadiths to justify sexual violence. Especially to people growing up in a very tumultuous environment. I'm not having a go at Islam. I don't expect someone who has been brought up with the holistic teachings of the quran to ever be able to justify this to themselves. But some kid orphan   who grew up to not know better might.
12- In many cases of rape globally testimonial evidence is all you have, and even then the rapist won't get convicted. I'm really concious of peddling to that problem.

For those claiming that rape definitely did not happen, what is your thought process? Do you have evidence or considerations that I haven't had? 

I for one would love to say ""definitely did not happen, stop using it to justify genocide and dehumanisation.""
But ATM, I can't discount that its a plausible thing to have happened. 

And I feel like hinging some of the support for Palestine around ""No rape happened"" if I can't discount it  delegitimises the support. It somewhat takes away from what the real injustices:
- generalization and dehumanisation - a person in hamas raped someone, therefore all Palestinians are evil.
- collective punishment - a person raped someone, their country must perish.
- erasure of context - ignoring 75 years of occupation, shooting peaceful protests, Pikachu surprise face at getting attacked. 
- racism, colonization, media bias, war profiteering, etc.

Idk, it's just niggling cause it bothers me, what's your view?

Sure, it'll be expensive but think of the massive good will you'd get by letting them have the settlements. If it was done sensibly then (unlike in the Gaza Strip) they may move in and make a go of living there.

The continued settlement and threat of annexation is one thing that Israel cannot overcome from a world-stage pov. Gaza is different - no settlers = they should be able to get on with it and build a nation. But no, they decided to cause trouble all the time.

If Israel gave the West Bank in it's entirety and Gaza continues with the violence no one could criticise Israel when it responds and you'd probably even get the Palestinians in the West Bank ON Israeli's side.

i7swl9,Handling of Israel/Jewish communities after Palestine is freed,"I am an American trying to learn more about the I/P conflict, but, generally, I have only gotten one side of the story, that being the Israel side.

I am told that, in Israel, Jewish communities and lifestyles are well established (for example, Kosher food options, synagogues, religious schools, etc), however, I have never been. 

With that, in the Palestinian side of the conflict, I often see ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"", a phrase to my understanding, means an end to the violent displacement, exclusion, and discrimination that Palestinians have faced as well as apartheid. On the other hand, in my research, many Jews say that the ""Free Palestine"" phrasing is a threat because it implies that the Jewish state would be eliminated. I can't say I know which definition of that is ""correct"" but I have been told it can mean many things to different people. 

I wanted to direct my question to an actual Palestinian community here because I feel there is good truth to that instead of just asking pro-Israel people how they feel. Hypothetically, once Palestine is freed (from the river to the sea), how would you handle the Jewish communities and Jewish way of life there (again, assuming it is there)? Would they have to leave their homes, could they stay? Something else altogether? Thank you for helping me understand this better.",dnsckid,2020-08-11,4,0.59,50,1

xuhys9,What would you say as a rebuttal when people say you can’t be queer and LGBTQ,"So as I came out as queer , I have been facing issues for my views on Palestine. 

To keep it short , I am anti Israeli apartheid and annexation and pro Palestinian in views. I not a Muslim / Christian and I am born into a Hindu family and from India. Do I think about it too much to make it my number one priority in fighting global issues ? Maybe not as I fight other issues in terms of local and national politics and I mostly give only vocal support . 

But my social circle who was just queer now has Zionists who feel that Israel is the only hope for LGBTQ and women in the Middle East so anyone who doesn’t support them is not just anti semitic but misogynistic and anti - LGBTQ by association hence I am being cancelled left and right . It’s bad enough that Hindus in general have HUGE islamophobia and right wing nationalism issues but somehow those people think Zionists are their friends for some reason. My good friend who is a proudly gay man even believes that Judaism unlike Islam is scripturally more pro woman and LGBTQ. I didn’t believe that because I am pretty sure the stories/vérses homophobic Muslims quote about Soddom and Gomorrah is from Hebrew bible but he says something about  rabbinic texts being more liberal 


In short , I would like to know more about 

1) What do Palestinian LGBTQ feel ?

2) is the claim that Palestinian LGBTQ people find solace in Israel and need Israel to be safe true ? Like I keep hearing stories that women escaping arranged marriages and LGBTQ facing violence escape to Israel for citizenship and later on housing also. 

3)The claim that Palestinian woman need to rely on Israel for basic freedoms like not wearing hijab and having an education",depressedkittyfr,2022-10-03,103,0.72,148,0

17snowr,Never understood how people can be this hateful,"I, non Palestinian, recently came across the second Yom Kippur subreddit and the posts are so alarming. The violence they promote is literally something an actual terrorist would say. For example, one of the posts was about the Israel Palestine hostage exchange and I kid you not, the top comment was ""I hope when they fully destroy hamas they just arrest them all again lmao"" and the comments replying to that disgusting post was ""agreed, except I hope they get killed in strikes"" and ""kill them"" 
I was in disbelief. They deny the atrocities of Israel and don't believe when evidence is shown. It was like I was talking to a nationalist. Any nationalist. It reminded me of the white nationalists that would disparage Jews with their conspiracy theories or any non-white person. I was so scared just thinking that these people live among us and think this way. How can there be so much hate? Every single post dehumanizing Palestine and they laugh at the suffering of the people. One post had people deny rape stating, ""as if a jew would even touch a Palestinian"" when evidence is shown! Another had bets on how many would be killed. I was reading this in horror! There are innocents dying and suffering and it is inhumane to deny and look away from that. I stand against antisemitism and this cannot be Judiasm. This is racist rhetoric and should not be tolerated. 
This is a rant. Sorry. I'm just in shock seeing how many people support genocide and the suffering of millions, not just in Gaza and WB but also those who are displaced in other nations. I hope Palestine gets another generation. And another. And another",kachow9996,2023-11-11,1,0.56,3,-1

ngr0vc,HAMAS,"I want to ask people of Palestinian ethnicity.   What I feel is an important question.

I have been discussing about Palestine on various forums.    What I find is that a lot of Israel people blame HAMAS for everything.    They don't necessarily blame the Palestinian people.   But they say HAMAS is stealing money from the Palestinian people.   And they do not represent Palestine.    And that HAMAS is actually trying to 'kill' their own people.

There was some weird logic on this.   According to people on Israel forum, they claim, Hamas wants Israel to bomb the Palestinian people.  Because it makes the world have sympathy for them (I am not agreeing with them, I feel both sides are to blame...especially the Israeli prime minister, he's a crook).

But these people (pro-Israel).  Had had all kinds of nasty things to say about HAMAS that I won't repeat.   And yet refuses to take any accountability for Israel's unethical practises.    Also...he claims that United Nations is 'anit-semantic'?     Whats that all about?

They claim also, if another organization was in charge instead of HAMAS (maybe the PLO?).    There would be peace.   Or maybe if the Palestinians were ruled over by a totally new governing body?

So...this is why I am here.    Do the Palestinians not like HAMAS?    What does the average Palestinian think about regarding HAMAS.   Or the PLO.   Or the other organizations that have governed over them?

For me, its very difficult for me to distinguish HAMAS from Israel.   Both are fighting for their survival.   And both kill civilians (just Israel kills more.)   So I'm confused.  

I read a little bit about HAMAS leadership, one was a quadropeligic?   Can anyone tell me more about this man?   Also...who is the current leader of HAMAS, and wasn't HAMAS democratically elected representative of Palestine?",elfletcho2011,2021-05-20,0,0.44,10,0

2as6j7,A message about the sourcing rule,"A lot of people have complained about/have been unclear as to what the source rule is for. I unilaterally made the decision to make this a new rule and I want to clarify why.

What I want for this subreddit is discussion. That does not mean rampant near-genocidalist statements about what should be done with the Palestinian people. It also does not mean that you can say *anything*. Of course, you technically *can* say anything you want, but without a standard, that becomes noise, and no longer a conversation.

Therefore, when you are making claims that you may not think are going to be readily accepted, we would prefer for you to include a source. It isn't necessary, but it simple serves to strengthen your own point. If someone directly asks you for a source, you don't have the advantage of having legitimized yourself first and foremost, and realistically, if we want to have an intellectual debate, it's almost obligatory that you then provide it. In fact, I want to hold this subreddit to a higher standard--no matter who the commenter happens to be--so it *is* obligatory.

That said, I realize that it *appears* unfair that no pro-Israeli news sources will be accepted. After all, we certainly aren't going to remove pro-Palestinian news sources. That seems like a contradiction, and it's not an easy thing to defend. However, I've just seen too many people citing editorials from Times of Israel as their ""officious"" source and I will not stand idly by while such dishonesty is permeated. It should be noted that this does not mean that *all* pro-Israeli sources or that Israeli sources are not accepted. If there is a *factual, accurate, and well sourced* pro-Israeli article that contains the information you are demonstrating, go for it (we love Haaretz, for better or worse--in fact, for all its faults, I'm pretty sure Israel has the greatest degree of free speech in the world). But it should be obvious that if you are being honest about your discussion, there should be plenty of other sources for you to use.

It's important to realize here that this does not mean that you *may not* post pro-Israeli articles *anywhere*. We had someone post a heavily biased video yesterday asking people to clarify and/or counter points for discussion. That is allowed.

The reason we make an exception for biased pro-Palestinian sources is that this sis /r/Palestine, and often times, these articles are written by Palestinians themselves. While we definitely try to maintain a level of freedom of speech, it should also be obvious why we need to make this exception. That being said, I would still like to see pro-Palestinians cite their sources well--it's just good practice.",,2014-07-15,0,0.48,2,0

2ao4by,Hello and welcome from r/PalestinianConflict....Your input in crafting a new sub is welcome,"Hello from /r/palestinianconflict , There has been [some debate](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/ciwmrs6) over on /r/worldnews about the sheer number of articles being upvoted to the front page relating to the Israel/Palestine conflict and how best to deal with them without resorting to removing a lot of them. 

Right now the solution is [one aggregate sticky thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2aluuc/news_from_israel_and_palestine_for_july_13th_14th/ ) where all articles relating the conflict can be posted but in my opinion that is not the best way to foster a discussion sicne many end up going unnoticed and I feel the time has come that the conflict warrants it's own dedicated subreddit where all media, opinion and first hand accounts can be discussed.

So to start this thing off I wanted to come to both /r/israel and /r/palestine to make the suggestion we take on board a moderator from both subreddits but with the final idea of keeping it a zero censorship and free speech zone with moderators to just keep debate on topic. 

Regarding the name I wanted to go with /r/IsraelPalestineConflict but the name is too long and /r/IsraelPalestine is being squatted with an inactive mod.

Anyway as I am crafting the (hopefully few) rules right now I would like to hear some input form as many sources as possible and since I am not a regular visitor on either /r/palesine or /r/israel so I'm not sure if my ambitious idea of having a mod from both is unrealistic but I would just like to hear peoples opinion on the subreddit and maybe get some good suggestions about how we can improve the standard of news delivery on reddit regarding the conflict.

Thanks and wishing a peaceful end for all sides involved ",the_viper,2014-07-14,1,0.54,3,1

A list of makes this human rights violators an apartheid regime 

Israel illegal occupation:

Laws Violated: International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (1976). “The practice of passing laws which give special favor throughout Israeli society to the Jewish people over
all other people, and especially the native Palestinian Arab people, embodies the UN definition of apartheid”

majority family unification”. 

“Israeli Actions: Studies by UN, I.C.J., and International H.R. organizations have found that Israel violates the human rights of Palestinian people including torture, imprisonment without charges or trial, land confiscation, harassment at checkpoints, unwarranted civilian shootings, not punishing Israeli settlers’ crimes against Palestinians, unwarranted disruption of medical care, commerce, employment, free movement, destruction of public and private property, family separation, etc….

populations to leave their houses for extensive periods of time”


ILLEGAL MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION OF LOCAL LAWS: Laws Violated: Hague Regulations IV, Article 43 (1907). Israeli Actions: Israel has created a dual legal system in the occupied territories – a democratic one linked to Israel for the Israeli settlements, and an oppressive, exploitive one for the Palestinian communities run by the Israeli military committees and Israeli-controlled civic administrations, replacing all Arab government functions with Israeli military committees, and dismissing or deporting all Arab government official.

2c89xe,Please stop calling Israel Nazis.,"When we are at war, we often use words to express our anger.
But calling Israel, or Israel supporters, Nazis, doesn't do justice to the Palestinians nor to the Israelis.

The Palestinians are a proud people seeking independence on their historic territory. They live either under siege or under occupation, it is sad and invokes anger and frustration for sympathizers of their cause. 

But the Palestinians are not a nation within a nation, they have leaders, they have weapons, government, schools, hospitals, boats, even a non-operational airport. 

For every 2 air attacks, approximately 1 Palestinian is killed in Gaza. That person may be a fighter, or an innocent bystander. With the proud Gazans who stand on rooftops, and successfully prevent Israeli air strikes, it seems like the Palestinians are doing a bad job of being Jews during the Holocaust.

The Palestinians (in Gaza, West Bank, or Israel) are not as worse off as the Jews were before and during the Holocaust.
And the Israelis are not seeking to take over the world while killing 100% Palestinians along the way.

It does not do Palestinians justice to continue to call Israel Nazi. Israel is Israel, Palestine is Palestine. Let's work with facts as much as possible, and not emotion.

2addfj,Overview: Gaza Massacre (July),"1. On May 17th, Israeli troops shot and killed 2 Palestinian youths during a demonstration not too long ago. The media largely ignored that.
http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.590861

2. Then on June 12, 3 Israeli teens *who were all Squatters* inside the West Bank, were captured / kidnapped and subsequently killed. The eldest among these boys was most likely serving in the military since all Jews 18+ has to serve the army for 3 years (however none of this justifies their kidnappings and their deaths). This whole incident took place in West Bank in the region of Hebron.
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/30/israel-kidnapped-teens-found-dead_n_5544233.html

3. In response an innocent Palestinian teen (civilian) was burned to death by Israeli forces. 
Even though there were only 2 suspects who allegedly did the kidnappings, more than 540 Palestinians were arrested or kidnapped. Brutal IDF home raids began which lead to the murder of 7 Palestinians, including a 7-year old, a 14 year old child, a 15-year-old, and a mentally ill man. Israeli forces also shut down 15 social welfare organizations that provide services to Palestinians. And then the bombing of Gaza began.
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/world/middleeast/autopsy-suggests-palestinian-boy-was-burned-alive-reports-say.html?_r=0
http://news.yahoo.com/israel-reins-west-bank-military-offensive-amid-fears-155713028.html
http://ifamericansknew.org/cur_sit/kidnap-response.html

4. As expected, Israel then began the continual bombing of Gaza and Hamas has also fired rocket into Israel (which caused no casualty as of this writing). Israel's missiles has targeted homes, social infrastructure and as of this writing, has killed over 78 Palestinians in the West Bank, most of whom are civilians and 14 of them happen to be children.
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/world/middleeast/israel-gaza.html


5. There was no court cases, no trials, no nothing regarding these kidnappings. The two alleged kidnappers have yet to be proven guilty in court. Yet on the basis of a bunch of jumped conclusions, Israel and Netanyahu just ""decided"" that Hamas must have done it and began bombing Gaza, even though the whole kidnapping incident happened in Hebron.

6. But wait, the kidnappings happened in West Bank, why are innocents in Gaza being bombed? What does the people of Gaza have to do with any of this at all? Why are Palestinians being collectively punished for the actions of two individuals?

7. Its important to note that half of Gaza's dead 'are women and children'. Israel has bombed homes, important essential infrastructures, disabled shelters and hospitals; so is Israel really targeting Hamas or just Palestinians?
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10960608/Half-of-Gazas-dead-are-women-and-children.html?utm_content=buffere1146&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer
http://mondoweiss.net/2014/07/essential-infrastructure-palestinians.html
http://mondoweiss.net/2014/07/hospital-missiles-volunteers.html

8. Moreover, why is there no mention of how the kidnappings might be a retaliation from Palestinians because 2 of their own teens were killed by Israeli troops during the Nakba demonstrations?

9. Hamas had no political motive or gain in killing these nobody teenagers. There was no trial, no court case, no nothing. Based on whimsical assumptions Israel is massacring civilian populations without any sort of remorse or hesitation.

10. Why is it ok to kill civilians? The two Palestinians who allegedly did the kidnappings and subsequent killings should be punished by the full extent of the law. But why should innocents who had nothing to do with this have to suffer?

10. Here is a great video that breaks down the the injustice of Israel's actions:

11. Watch how the media twists the entire story to favor Israel when Israel is the dangerous, deranged, monstrous apartheid state. No matter what people say you can't justify what Israel is doing.

The two deals that come to mind are giving large portions of the West Bank and giving the Gaza Strip.  In both cases, instead of it leading to improved diplomatic relations, a war was sparked.  Is there a reason, other than left wing politicians being in power in Israel who ideologically hold that land-for-peace is the only solution, for Israel to take this course of action.  

As a sub-question, I would like to know why it is considered a good decision for the Palestinians to engage in these wars when they cause more civillian casualties on the Palestinian side than they do on the Israeli side and civillians dying doesn't really seem like the path to peace.

hn3bna,Evidence of Intelligence Agency Involvement in The Alt Right and Reddit/4chan," (this may appear off topic but in fact refers to the actions of the Israeli Government at many points, and actors who support it)

I'm gonna post this all across Reddit, 4chan etc because it relates to these communities. This is what I have spent the last month of lockdown doing. I have titled this article, 'The Truth About The Alt Right: A Destruction By Facts and Logic.' Part of the reason I write this article is that I sincerely hope those on the Alt-Right consider its implications and question their beliefs. The other part is that I sincerely hope the left begins to more fully understand the scope of the alt-right itself, but also of the intelligence agencies who, I believe I have shown in this article, are the creators and backers of the alt-right movement. I hope that perhaps they might consider what they could do to combat these influences specifically online.

While the alt-right have money, we have a lot of people. In the article I first outline who the alt right are and what they believe, as well as outlining a fairly orthodox theory of where fascism comes from. I then discuss The Roots of the Alt Right and the connections to intelligence agencies therein, their relationship to the conspiracy theory community and other alternative media. I also give a brief history of 4chan. I then discuss the Alt-Right itself, the alt-right specific theories such as Pizzagate and Qanon, as well as the alt-rights involvement the election of Donald Trump.

From here, I go on to discuss the various different groups and interests who put large amounts of money behind the election of Donald Trump. This money paid for the astroturfing of various forums on the internet, including Reddit and 4chan, by these paid meme magic factories. Those who paid for these factories are some interesting characters, including one Jim Dowson a Scottish Banker with Ulster Loyalist links, part of a shadowy group called The Knights Templar International, ruled by a mysterious 'Council of Nine'. Yes, you heard me correctly.

Outside of these interests, I also show the massive and blatant amount of intelligence agency interference in these communities. I then go on discuss the esoteric leanings of many of these Neo Nazi groups implicated in this astroturfing campaign, as well as their own connections to intelligence groups, which are often direct and stark. I discuss generally how these various influences have formed a militant anti left bloc, with global reach and influence as well as considerable militant capabilities. This network forms a Fascist International and has links right to the top of many states. 4Chan and Reddit have been a key media outlet in their growth.

I am aware the article is very long, so if you have a pretty good grasp 4chan/Reddit history, you can skip ahead to the section, Entitled 'The God Emporer Saves Us From His Pedophile Friends' , or, if you want to get straight to the sections most relevant to 4chan and Reddit, you can skip to the section entitled 'Evidence of Glow Posting'. It is from this section of the article that the whole thing grew. I wanted to collect the little evidence I had of glow posting into one document, that lead here and there and now I have over 20,000 words. You will find that at the start of the article in the introduction there are few citations, don't assume that is because I don't use them, I reference 143 sources in total. This is a link to the article. Hope you find it interesting.

ha2nqz,Where in Israel/Palestine do Palestinians want to return to? (Specific details),"I had an idea that Israel could allow Palestinians to decide whether they want to return to Israel or Palestine. They currently provide financial benefits to Jews to encourage them to make aliyah to Israel, so they could use the money saved from ending the conflict to provide the same benefits to Palestinians that choose to return to Palestine (to encourage Palestinians to choose Palestine over Israel, keep the Jewish majority in Israel, and help develop the Palestinian economy)

I've been told that this idea wouldn't work because Palestinians don't have the connection to the state but rather individual towns and villages, and nothing would make them choose a new home in Palestine over their old family village in Israel. 

TLDR: My question is whether there's any kind of research into where Palestinians would choose to go if they had the choice? Which regions/districts/towns/villages? How many to each area?",jrjr20,2020-06-16,0,0.5,1,0

43rbgb,[Discussion] Trump as POTUS.,"This is a serious discussion about Trump's potential presidency. There is a very real possibility he could win. If either Clinton or Bernie win the nomination, the loser's supporters are likely to vote for Trump instead of staying within the party. I think a lot will depend on who the candidates choose to run with (VP). Sure he is a crass individual and has blatant biases, however, they are easily identifiable and by no means malicious. He panders to his audience, so certain things he says can be legitimately dismissed. Trump even supports universal healthcare, which potentially makes him more liberal than Clinton (the centrist democratic warhawk candidate). He says he is a traditionalist, but also doesn't mind your sexual choice or religious identity. Yes, he said we should ban Muslims (temporarily) out of pandering to Republicans to one up Ben Carson's comments and get back in the spot-light at a time when he was losing steam. I see no reason to believe he is maliciously racist or anti-any religion. 

Donald is also a **pragmatic** man. Zionists are not fond of him. Shouldn't we, Palestinians of all backgrounds, embrace him? The other options are Israeli apologists (Sanders, Clinton). Trump couldn't care less about who owns Palestine, I bet. Which is a step up from a negative US association with Palestinians. Since he is using his own money to run, we don't have to fear AIPAC bribery. He wants support; not money. Everyone points out his faults and he doesn't mind laughing at them as well. He also understands the corporate loopholes better than any of the candidates (domestic concern) and has the most sound understanding of our economy. 

Is it too hopeful to think he could change the status quo in Palestine or at least continue the apolitical stance toward Israel started by Netanyahu's feud with Obama?

17ur1fq,Confronting your partner in the military about the conflict,"Hi everyone,

I am speaking today as the partner of someone who is currently on active duty in the US military. We are on a long-term medium-distance relationship going 9 months strong at the moment and we see each other every week.

I am very sad and frustrated at my partner’s irreconcilable stance on this conflict, as he has been consistently upset visiting me due to the scale and frequency of the protests here. 
Where I live here, we have weekly pro-Palestinian protests and our marches are some of the largest in the Western world (don’t quote me on this though!) 

He is aware that I am a fervent supporter of the pro-Palestinian cause, but equally, he is quite literally, aversive towards that same cause. He tries to avoid the protests (though it's everywhere here at this point, both from police presence and the actual protestors), and always tells me that he tries to see ""both sides of the stories"" all the time. But this has made me feel powerless, as it has affected the way he expresses himself emotionally ever since this conflict happened.

I’ve tried to stop talking about politics with him, but that doesn’t help given that we talk about the news all the time and I happened to have studied politics as well as a degree. I want to confront this standpoint of his, but I don’t want this to compromise my relationship with him. I love him for who he is as a person, not his job.

I am fully aware of what his job entails and what it stands for especially in this conflict, but I have always managed to shrug it past him and see him for who he is. I never try to let the political beliefs of someone define one’s character and traits, but this projection of his is making it hard for me to interact with him well.

Assuming that a deal is made where Israel withdraws all settlements, blockades, removes control over the area with water, electricity and other things. Assuming they imprison any fringe groups attempting to take land from Palestinians. Assuming that they only take the most necessary steps for self-protection, leaving Palestinians untouched and allowed to self-realisation. Would that be possible?

17cacrm,I’m confused about this man. Please read and share your thoughts.,"Okay so I’m from the uk and as a Muslim I go to an all Muslim high school. This school is part of Star Academies which is basically the only and therefore the largest Muslim school trust that makes all boys and girls schools throughout the country. The man behind this whole thing is Mufti Hamid, a man I, as well as a lot of students probably, respected a LOT growing up. He’s a national leader of education and even has a knighthood from the Queen. 

My point is that today he made a ‘dua’(a prayer) for the Palestinian people which was broadcast through all the schools in the trust, except he didn’t say the word PALESTINE once.

mzxy8b,"What do you think of a secular, multicultural one-state solution from river to sea?","A common thing that I see among many educated Palestinians, especially the 48 Palestinians, is the dream of a secular, binational one-state solution, from the river to the sea, where everyone is equal, and all ethnicities can become president. A state for all its citizens, regardless of ethnicity or religion. This is presented as a solution to the Palestinian refugees who want to return and to the 48’ers who wish to remain where they are, and for the settlers who wish to continue living in the WB. The only “unwanted” thing here is that it would stop being a Jewish state, becoming a normal, secular country like Germany and every other country. 

Among famous intelectuals, israelis Ilan Pappe and Gideon Levy are strong supporters of it. 

This solution also says that the root of the problem is the mistaken assumption that Palsstinian belonging and Jewish safety are mutually exclusive. It says that this narrative was pushed by both extremist sides in the beginning, with the Jewish extremists saying that there could be no Jewish safety without expelling the Palestinians, and the Palestinian side saying that there could be no Palestinian belonging without expelling the colonizers. 

But we don’ have to choose. We never did. And this is the root of all problems. 

Everybody could live happily ever after in a normal, secular, multicultural state. 

I’m more and more convinced that this would be the ideal cenario. Of course, the reality of actually implementing it would be very hard, and with the way things are it’s good enough that they finally stop the Occupation of the WB and give us a two-state solution. It’s just that a two-state solution still leaves the 48-Palestinians living as 2nd class citizens in their own country, and prevents the refugees from returning to their original villages. Of course now there is too much hate for that, but things can change with time. A few decades ago, South Africa was a very different place than it is now. 

The flag would be someting that represented the new state, like the image of an olive tree, similar to Lebanon’s, and everything would be bilingual. The state would be called something “neutral”, like Holy Land or Jerusalem or Palestine&Israel / Israel/Palestine.

2carfa,"Everyone, please share this message to anyone that supports Israel and prove everything they said wrong","To the Zionist trolls who continue bringing up their top four most absurd arguments to justify these latest atrocities: 

1) ""Hamas fired 1,394 rockets at Israel!""

How many rockets, missiles, tank shells, cluster bombs, white phosphorous bombs, bullets, cannons and grenades has Israel unleashed on the Palestinians? It's a sad situation and only reflective of the evident bias when you can count to the 3rd decimal point the number of Hamas projectiles but be completely clueless about Israel's arsenal.

2) ""Israel is defending itself. What would you do if someone was firing rockets at your country?!""

A: If I occupied a people, placed a crippling trade and economic embargo on them, placed them under siege, humiliated them daily via military and police checkpoints, controlled their water and electricity, constructed apartheid ""Jewish-only roads"", shot their children, bombed their schools, mosques and businsses, illegally seized their lands, destroyed their crops, demolished their homes, threw thousands of them in dungeons and treated them like sub-humans and they fired rockets at me - I would probably stop doing all of the above.

Secondly, Israel has been mass murdering the Palestinians for over 60 years - long before any rockets were fired and long before Hamas was even in existence. So this is nothing but a fallacy designed to deflect the reality of the situation and mislead others. Finally, Israel's indiscriminate use of heavy weaponry in civilian areas is a war crime, not self defense.

3) ""This is Hamas's fault, they use human shields. Israel doesn't target civilians!""

A: Excuse me, when you launch an unbridled, indiscriminate attack from warships, fighter jets, tanks, artillery and helicopters on a CIVILIAN AREA - what do you expect to find there - breakdancing hobbits? When you attack civilian areas, you kill civilians. It's not Advanced Chinese Mathematics. 

Gaza is the most densley populated place on earth. It's an open air prison. So when Israel fires into these areas it is going to kill and maim people every time.

Secondly, according to the Israeli Human Rights group, Beit Selem which tracks both Israel and Palestinian deaths, dozens of children as young as 4 years old were killed with gunshot wounds to the HEAD AND CHEST. Not to mention the videos coming through showing snipers killing rescuers. Bombing ambulances and hospitals also has to be the most cowardly thing a military could do. So I'm afraid this ""doesn't target civilians"" statement doesn't hold up the facts.

4) ""Israel is the most moral and humane army in the world. Who else calls/texts people and drops leaflets warning them to evacuate before a pending attack?""

I love this one. 

""Please be notified in 5 minutes, we are going to destroy your home.""

In other words, Israel publicly announces to thousands of civilians their full intent to perpetrate yet another war crime and you're asking us to somehow acknowledge this as some type of humane gesture? The gall.

How about a rapist or murderer ""notify"" their victims by sending them text messages/leaflets that they're coming shortly to rape and murder them - does it make it any less perverse? If this is the level of desperation Zionists and their sympathisers have stooped to, then it's little wonder public opinion is God willing, starting to turn against them.

As for ""evacuating""...

Have you seen a map of Gaza? If so, could you please explain to me where the Palestinians are supposed to ""evacuate"" to? To the north and east, they are blocked by Israeli walls and military checkpoints. To the south is Egypt's closed crossing thanks to Israel's slave, Sissy. To the west is the Mediterranean Sea. So what do they do, swim for it and hope they can make it to Cyprus or Turkey before Israel ""defends itself"" again and machine guns them all in the water? 

Go to a UN shelter? Wait, they tried that already TWICE - once in Qana, Lebanon and once in Gaza a few years ago and Israel ""defended itself"" by bombing the shelters massacring a total of 352 civilians. Add to this, Israel's naval and air forces who have killed thousands of people are constantly patrolling the areas. They are surrounded from every imaginable direction and you sit from the comfort of your sofa sipping $8 coffee then froth at the mouth demanding they evacuate.",hammad22,2014-08-01,7,0.59,7,1

However, whether by through a bilateral agreement, pressure from the international community, or some mixture of both; what if a 2-state solution like this was on the table? 

1.) Divided Hebron mountain range to allow for both Israel and Palestine to have some level of defensible borders. 

2.) A split city of Jerusalem under the boundaries set by the 1967 agreement. 

3.) A continuous Palestine land mass with access to the Mediterranean via Gaza and the Red Sea via Eilat. 

Please answer the following and feel free to add your own comments. 

1.) Would you prefer this arrangement over the 1967 borders? 

2.) Assuming somehow that even the most hardline Israelis politicians agreed to go along with this, do you think the Palestinian leadership (Hamas and Fatah) would agree to a solution like this?

17b7u3m,"If Palestine succeeds in being ""free from the river to the sea"" where do all the Israeli Jews go?","I have been wondering about this question for a long time. No Pro-Israel will ask it and no Pro-Palestinian has addressed it.

**Where do Israeli Jews go after a successful Palestine movement?**

The Palestinian movement has popularized the saying ""from the river to the sea Palestine will be free"".

That implies that Israel to be totally taken over and their country be taken off the map. It is apparent that the Palestinian government and its supporters of the Arab world do not tolerate people of Jewish faith.

Over the past 100 years Islamic North African countries and Middle East countries have seen Jewish populations drop from a considerable amount to essentially 0 this implies that these Arab governments that back Palestine are anti Jewish. To extend on that there have been many stories of Jews not allowed into Palestine just because they are Jewish.

If Palestine succeeds in their complete freedom goal from ""the river to the sea"" that would displace an estimated 7.3 million Israeli Jews who would not be welcome in the new Arab-backed Palestinian government.

This would cause a mass of people who suddenly don't have a home. 

Where do all of these new displaced people go? Do we establish a ""new Israel"" somewhere different or does the Non-Islamic world have an obligation to accept millions of Israeli refugees all at a moments notice?

19alu0z,"Blinken's diplomacy in Gaza: Israel would not tolerate “one drop of water, not one ounce of fuel” across the border; 9-hour negotiating session; aid in exchange of a Biden visit","I had come around this article from the [TIME](https://time.com/collection/davos-2024-ideas-of-the-year/6551990/antony-blinken-israel-gaza-us-power/) , outlining the Secretary of State's ""wins"" during the war happening in Gaza. Now it's either complete propagandist crap to embellish their administration efforts for when it's reelection time, or it was a cold hard realization that Netanyahu is genuinely a genocidal monster that can't be tamed - not even by the U.S. to save face. The article still reports the gross misinformation of shot and burned baby bodies. It reports on the protests and international pressure and Israel's war crimes and regional leaders stance. 

Here are excerpts: 

>The visit had started off with a show of U.S. support after the brutal Hamas attack on Oct. 7, followed by talks with Arab allies. But as Israel intensified its bombing campaign in Gaza, Blinken decided to make a U-turn. Cut off from water, food, medicine, and fuel, the enclave was spiraling into a humanitarian crisis. Arriving back in Israel, Blinken conveyed to Netanyahu the anger he had heard from regional leaders and urged him to allow aid into Gaza. In a tense meeting punctuated by an air-raid siren, Netanyahu was intractable. **Israel would not tolerate “one drop of water, not one ounce of fuel” across the border, a senior Administration official said.** As it grew dark, Blinken and his aides followed Netanyahu from the Kirya, Israel’s version of the Pentagon, to the underground command center. Huddled around two laptops and a mobile printer, in a small room with no cell service, the U.S. team traded proposals with the Israeli cabinet next door. Some came back with Netanyahu’s hand-scribbled edits.

&#x200B;

How the hell is it that dystopian that you had to dangle a visit from the president just to let innocent civilians survive? How the hell would you even celebrate it as ""logic prevailed""?

&#x200B;

>Finally, the Israeli Prime Minister and America’s top diplomat sat down alone. If Israel was going to proceed in its mission to destroy Hamas, **it had to allow aid to reach civilians**, Blinken told Netanyahu. He also made clear what was hanging in the balance: **a visit from President Joe Biden**, the prospect of which had leaked to the Israeli media but had yet to be formalized. A visit from Biden represented a critical gesture of support—and significant leverage. At 3 a.m., Blinken went in front of the cameras to announce that Biden would visit the country in two days to reaffirm his “ironclad commitment” to its security—and that Israel had agreed to allow food and medical supplies to reach civilians in Gaza. Five days later, the first 20 trucks rolled in. “Ultimately the logic prevailed,” Blinken told TIME in an interview in his wood-paneled office at the State Department in late December, his voice hoarse after the latest whirlwind trip.

>**Most nights, Blinken** returns home after his two young children’s bedtime. So he has made it a priority to have breakfast with them in the morning. On Dec. 8, they were interrupted by protesters outside his house. “**Blinken, Blinken, rise and shine**,” they chanted, “**you’re committing genocide.**”  
>  
> ....From his window, the Secretary of State has a view of the Lincoln Memorial, a temple erected in tribute to a President who led during a period of rupture in the Republic. As Blinken spoke, a cleaning crew was scrubbing a message splashed in bright red paint over its marble steps. The words were still visible: “**Free Gaza**.”

19acl1j,Martin Luther King Jr's holiday just past in America. Pro Palestinians should not let the Pro Israel side propagandise his image to defend Israel's racist occupation.,"So Martin Luther King Jr's holiday just past. And like every year people selectively quote MLK. In this year particularly it has been aggregiously selective because people have of course used and weaponised MLK's image for the Israel-Palestine war. Amy Schumer was already doing it earlier selectively quoting MLK on Israel and antisemitism. His daughter Bernice King shut that down with a statement coming out in support of a ceasefire.

In order to effectively shut down this propaganda we need to know one simple point. What was MLK's view on the Palestine issue? His views can be summarised as the following: A)Trying to figure out the facts on the issue and where to stand. B)Evolving towards a Pro Palestine position that was cut short by his assassination. And we have scholarship to back this up. I encourage people to read the work by Michael Fishbach **Black Power and Palestine.** What we see when we discuss the facts is the following:

* MLK came out of a context in the 60s where the Pro Israel narrative was THE dominant narrative, even on the political left and even in minority communities and the developing world. It was only in the 1970s this changed globally when Palestinian nationalism went global. MLK is shot before this globalisation
* Towards the end of the Civil Rights Movement, it face attacks not just from the FBI through its extensive COINTELPRO, or the police department, but increasing from those who took a Pro Israel perspective because many Black groups were evolving to the Pro Palestine position. SNCC for example(Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) came out after the six day war and supported Palestinian Liberation because of the influence of Black Power figures like Stokely Carchmichael. Because of this the Pro Israel groups, weaponising the historic Black-Jewish solidarity networks that had been built, organised a boycott of SNCC that crippled it significantly. In this context, a well as the context of FBI repression, KKK attacks, assassination threats, and white liberal allies turning on him because of his denunciation of the Vietnam War, he was trying to figure out when to say what on this issue.
* King as I mentioned was starting to evolve on the issue. In 1967 when talking to his aides he speaks of how he was hearing criticisms from the Arab world that he ""did not understand"" their issues and he seemed ""Pro Israel"". That same year he was due for a visit to the area as part of a religious pilgrimage. This was the same time the 6 day war happened. After it happened King canceled the visit. According to the research he canceled the visit because he said his ""gut instinct"" told him it would not be a good idea due to the fact that it would look like he was endorsing occupation to the people of Africa, Asia and the Arab world. This is important because Dr King saw the Civil Rights Movement as being allied to the global struggle against colonialism at the time. So listening to the criticism, he canceled his visit to the area. 
* Dr King in an interview he did called for ABC News called ""issues and answers"" when asked about the Middle East responded that all though he thought Israel had a right to exist, also made it clear that Israel needs to give back the territories they conquered from the Palestinian Arabs, other wise it would fuel bitterness and exacerbate the conflict. So he openly said that land needs to be given back. 
* In 1959 when MLK was on a foreign tour he had visited India and Lebanon. After this he did a brief stop to the Holy Land. The stop was actually because he had to see a doctor. In the process he went through the West Bank, which was then occupied by Jordan. He ended up being treated by a Armenian-Palestinian doctor in order to examine the scar tissue of a stab wound he got back in America that put him in the hospital. After his treatment the Dr was about to leave and he said ""sit down sir, we would like to talk"". They Dr who was surprised spoke to King about the situation. Then he organised a meeting of various Palestinian political figures and on the ground people who were surprised that Martin Luther King was in the West Bank. This is significant for a couple of reasons. The first is that visit that Dr King was planning in 67, he planned to include the Dr and these guest that he met in 1959. Some of them had been people expelled in the 1948 war. Which is interesting because the trip that he canceled for fear that it might be seen as an endorsement of the occupation was a trip that ironically he planned to include survivors of the Nakba. The second reason this is important is because when he came back he gave a sermon on his trip to the Holy Land. In this sermon he uses the metaphor of the passion of Christ and the man who helps Jesus carry the cross. In this metaphor the Third world and colonised people globally are like the crucified Christ. And the black man in America is like the man helping Jesus. Essentially this means solidarity. And the basis of this comparison is both his experience in India and the West Bank. He is saying that the poor masses in India as well as the Palestinian Arabs he encountered in the West Bank remind him of the crucified Christ. 

Now we need to be clear about something. As great as Dr King was, he was not a perfect man who is above criticism. And this includes his position here. There were still problematic elements to some of his views on the conflict. The fact that he was not vocal enough at the time is something pointed out by the late Edward Said in his autobiography as well as his nephew Usama Makdisi and it is a fair criticism. Some of his statements about Israel being ""one of the great outposts of democracy"" is problematic and worthy of criticism. But we need to tell the full picture. And the full picture was that coming from the context he was coming from, he was evolving his views. And they were moving in the Pro Palestinian direction. Had he lived past 1968 just like his comrades, he would have been fully vocal on the Palestine issue and we know this because at the end he was taking anti imperialist stances across the board and condemning America as the ""greatest purveyors of violence in the world"". When the U.S was dropping bombs in Vietnam and rationalising civilian casualties by saying the Vietcong were ""using human shields"" he openly said America were war criminals and compared them to the German army. Had he lived past 1968 and he saw Israel doing the same thing in Palestine and using the same talking points he would have said the exact same thing. Especially since he canceled his visit because he didn't want to be seen as supporting occupation. Add to this the fact that he already supported other Arab anti colonial struggles such as Ahmed Ben Bella and the Algerian revolution against French settler colonialism which was literally the same thing. So don't let anyone weaponise MLK's image against the Palestinian cause when these are the real facts here. ",Anglicanpolitics123,2024-01-19,38,0.94,3,-1

19aegho,Max Blumenthal: Israel’s Wider War,"Max Blumenthal discusses Netanyahus rejection of a Palestinian state, the cycle of escalation the Biden administration have created in refusing to call for a ceasefire, Ansarullah’s (Houthi) moral military intervention to apply economic pressure on Israel to get it to stop genocide, and the US response to South Africa’s ICJ case. 


Excerpt from the interview—

“The actual phrase Netanyahu used is ‘from the west of the Jordan River’ basically: ‘Israel has to control everything from the Mediterranean to the west of the Jordan River’ so essentially it is ‘from The River To The Sea, that's where the exclusively Jewish state of Israel will be’ where Israel will have total security control.

Which doesn't actually mean the state of Israel will officially declare itself. It means the military will control everything, or it will control everything through a security subcontractor like the Palestinian Authority— a kind of Vichy authority. But essentially one state, which is the reality right now, is what Netanyahu's openly advancing and always has. 

A few weeks ago he boasted that he had helped foil the two-state solution. There's video leaked from a meeting he had with settlers in 2002 where he boasted that he'd destroyed the two-state solution and tricked the Americans. That he knows how to move the Americans. 

This is Netanyahu's appeal to the Jewish Israeli public where there is no constituency at all for the two-state solution that Tony Blinkin is so disingenuously pushing in place of an actual ceasefire and a cessation of this devastating conflict which constantly expands during his 10 country anti-diplomacy tour. 

So here's the reality of what the Americans are dealing with and they refuse to accept it. And meanwhile back at home here in the US the presidents of Harvard and University of Pennsylvania were sacked because they refused to ban student groups that declare ‘from The River To The Sea, Palestine will be free’ in other words ‘Palestinians will not be governed by a military dictatorship from The River To The Sea’. So this whole speech by Netanyahu is suffused with irony”",Joonam_s2,2024-01-19,13,0.93,3,-1

1995rzp,"Ben & Jerry's board is advocating for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, potentially fuelling fire with its parent company, Unilever.","""Peace is a core value of Ben & Jerry's,"" said board chair Anuradha Mittal stated. ""From Iraq to Ukraine, the company has consistently stood up for these principles. Today is no different as we call for peace and a permanent and immediate ceasefire.

This move is particularly significant in light of recent debates over corporate responses to the Hamas attack on Israelis on 7th October and the subsequent Israeli military actions in Gaza.

The company's decision comes amid a backdrop of global boycotts targeting major firms like Starbucks and McDonald's who have been criticised for their perceived support of Israel.

""Ben & Jerry's has a long history of supporting peace and peace-building,"" stated a spokesperson, who clarified the ceasefire statement represents the views of its independent board.

The Vermont-based ice cream maker has a history of progressive activism, a legacy that predates its acquisition by Unilever in 2000. However, this activism has occasionally led to tension with Unilever.

In 2022, Ben & Jerry's sued Unilever for selling its business in Israel and the contested West Bank region to a local licensee, citing this move as contrary to Unilever's 2021 commitment to cease sales in the region in support of the Palestinian cause.

The situation escalated when Unilever reportedly froze the salaries of Ben & Jerry's board members as a pressure tactic related to the Israeli ice cream deal.",InformalFly3000,2024-01-17,532,0.98,37,-1

Scholz is trying to justify a genocide in court and lecture the entire world on the ANNIVERSARY of the first shameful genocide in their history against the Herero and Nama in modern-day Namibia. Not only that - they say ""This accusation has no basis whatsoever"". Cherry on top they draw their entitlement from the most heinous crimes of them all, the Shoah. 

""In view of German history and the crime against humanity of the Holocaust, the federal government is particularly committed to the Convention on Genocide. This convention is a central instrument of international law to implement the 'never again.' We strongly oppose any political instrumentalization.""

It has a lot of gas + oil companies as well as some Israeli companies, some of which are directly supporting Israel against Gaza right now. The difficulty I have is that I've tried researching for ETFs that don't include any Israeli companies and quite a few of the companies in these funds have publicly supported Israel against Gaza. I'd be curious to know if anyone knows any good ETFs or funds that I can invest in in my UK stocks and shares ISA that don't make contributions to any companies like these?

Investigative journalist David Sheen explains the education Israelis soldiers receive at top military academies in Israel.

In a 2019 lecture at the University of Zurich, Sheen discloses the racist and extremist teachings of prominent rabbis delivering lectures to soldiers. For example, rabbi Eliezer Kashtiel advocates for the return of slavery, expressing discriminatory views against non-Jews. Another rabbi, Giora Redler, downplays the Holocaust and praises Adolf Hitler. Rabbi Yosef Kelner condemns secular Jews, labelling them as traitors deserving death. Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh, who published a book called The King's Torah, says, ‘There is justification for killing babies if it is clear that they will grow up to harm us.’",shqear,2024-01-16,735,0.98,36,-1

Perhaps they think that ultimately meaningless platitudes will shield them from the accusation that THEY STAYED SILENT while thousands of Palestinian children had their bodies ripped apart or suffered hideously painful and prolonged deaths, their last tortured breathes exhaled from their mangled and shattered little bodies under the rubble, all with a direct involvement from our own governments.

19759v3,"Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that ""no one will stop"" him and the Israeli military in its destructive campaign in Gaza.","
""No one will stop us - not the Hague, not the Axis of evil, and no one else,"" Netanyahu warned.

Netanyahu spoke after the International Court of Justice at the Hague held two days of hearings following South Africa's allegation that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians.

Over the weekend in Gaza, the death toll has continued to rise with at least 125 Palestinians killed and 265 injured, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.

More than 23,500 people have been killed in the strip of land since the war began, according to Al Jazeera.

In Israel, somber events were held to mark the 100 days since some hostages have been held in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the tension between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group continues to increase as fire is traded almost daily.

Two Israeli civilians were killed in northern Israel on the 100th day of the war.
Overall hostility in the region is on the rise with Iran-backed militias attacking US targets in Syria and Iraq - trying to push the power out of the region - while Yemen's Houthi rebels that targeted shipping triggered a wave of US and UK airstrikes with at least five killed just two days ago.

Moreover, South Africa opened a case with the ICJ against Israel, arguing that the country is violating the 1958 Genocide Convention to which both countries are signatories.

My father's family moved in 1948 from Jenin and my mother's family was ethnically cleansed from Lydd in 1948. Both sides of my mom's family didn't keep in touch, some ended up in Gaza, some stayed in Lydd, and others moved to Damascus with her family. My grandparents and all my uncles and aunts were alive during the Nakba, my mom was the only one born in Syria in 1949. The exodus was very difficult as my grandmother had to stay to her father in Ramallah and never saw him again because he headed to Gaza and she went to Damascus where she passed away 6 months after giving birth to my mom.   


I don't know much about my grandmother's family (Shkookani), but have more information about my grandfather's family. In either case, my mom, aunts and uncles didn't keep in touch with their cousins on either side, and I'd like to know if anyone has had any success reaching out to people. I would love to know more of our relatives wherever they are, and I'm especially interested in learning more about my grandmother since we do not have one photo of her, and who knows, maybe this search will help me give my mom and aunts and uncles (10 of them, 9 left now but they are all pretty old) a photo of their mom.

197afzu,In western media Israelis are slaughtered while Palestinians “died”. Israeli deaths mentioned 16x more than Palestinians.,"“THE NEW YORK Times, Washington Post, and Los Angeles Times’s coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza showed a consistent bias against Palestinians, according to an Intercept analysis of major media coverage. “

“Highly emotive terms for the killing of civilians like “slaughter,” “massacre,” and “horrific” were reserved almost exclusively for Israelis who were killed by Palestinians, rather than the other way around. (When the terms appeared in quotes rather than the editorial voice of the publication, they were omitted from the analysis.)

The term “slaughter” was used by editors and reporters to describe the killing of Israelis versus Palestinians 60 to 1, and “massacre” was used to describe the killing of Israelis versus Palestinians 125 to 2. “Horrific” was used to describe the killing of Israelis versus Palestinians 36 to 4. “

“During discussions around the prisoner exchanges, this frequent refusal to refer to Palestinians as children was even more stark, with the New York Times referring in one case to “Israeli women and children” being exchanged for “Palestinian women and minors.” (Palestinian children are referred to as “children” later in the report, when summarizing a human rights groups’ findings.) “",OkArrival9,2024-01-15,107,0.95,10,0

Israel is trying to stop any aid at all from getting into Gaza. Is Egypt really going to allow an Israeli military operation so close to Egyptian territory? Egypt can't allow the last remaining route into Gaza to be controlled by Iarael. 

""Israeli leaders have yet to green-light the operation but have notified Egyptian authorities of the plan and are coordinating with them......An Egyptian source denied this, telling Al-Arabi Al-Jadeed that ""There is no truth to what the media reported regarding coordination with Israel""

Israel lie? No way. Egpyt is coordinating with the IDF??? Apparently, Rafah has been open during much of the war for humanitarian reasons. Israel needs to start putting more effort into their lies. Egypt put out a public statement. Israel is solely responsible for the humanitarian situation.

1975m2y,3d help needed to help Palestine Kids,"Hello.

I’m an Art director who has an idea that would make A LOT of noise toward helping the Palestine Children. The idea's meaning is to have a lot of impact on local governments and public opinion while being fairly simple in itself.

&#x200B;

It’s early stage and I’m looking for someone who can help draw in 3D or place the idea in a highly realistic manner - to visualize the idea to an NGO like Amnesty.

This is the first step, while if you want, we can continue to create the idea further down the road.

&#x200B;

This is completely pro bono (for myself too), unless things change in the future.

&#x200B;

*15/12-23 the children's death count was above 7700 = equaling 9.5 km in a long line.*

Pm me if you’re interested. Cheers.

196yvdk,Solidarity in Life and in Death,"This will be my first (and probably my only) post on this sub and I want to make my position on this very clear : I condemn the United States government as well as the State of Israel for their blatant abuse of global influence and military power. I do not support either party, as they have made their positions in our history books abundantly known. With that being said, as a United States citizen, I did my duty by using my voice to educate as many as possible within the confines of my social media reach regarding the genocide happening in Gaza. even if it was against my better judgement due to the nature of some of the content (i.e graphic images and videos showing the destruction Israel is raining down on Gaza). I have a lot of very close family and friends on social media, and i know that even though they choose to be cognitively dissonant, i felt an obligation to shove it in their face so they could see the children they condemn to death. Is this a form of exploitation? I sure hope not. But i do hope they felt a shred of the trauma Gaza has suffered for the past 100 days.

Unfortunately from what we’ve seen thus far, no amount of shouting or boycotting will make these “people” understand they have lost the faith and trust of the people here in the US. I mean, they already got paid, so why would they give a damn? 

So i’ve decided to take it a step further. The reason I am writing this so that it may one day be used as evidence indicating my resistance to this war machine. Is it the right move? Probably not & if anyone has advice - i’d love to hear it, but I’ve decided to mark myself as exempt on my W4, and implore you all to do the same. I will not pay another dollar, not another dime, to contribute to the war crimes being committed by the United States and the State of Israel. 

I will take the money they would originally withhold and place it in a secure location, and once both the United States government and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can PROVE they are not complicit with war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, i will pay what I owe and not a moment before. I request an itemized list of where my taxes are going, specifically, and if not then as i said before….

I can, and will, prove that I do not support nor have i expressed my explicit consent to have my taxes be used to fuel this war machine.

This could result in legal consequences, and to which I say bring it on. I cannot sit here and say I have done everything possible to show my support for the people in Gaza if I haven’t taken a risk. If need be, i shall denounce my citizenship and declare myself the sovereign state of I. Whatever it takes. I am but one man, with a wife and son. Should the same happen here in the US, I would hope there’s at least one person like myself on the other side of the world willing to take an equal risk to show their solidarity with me. 

At some point we must take an indefinite stand for humanity. Or this cycle of hatred will be the legacy we leave to those who come after us. This is not a battle between differing ends of the political spectrum, nor is it about race or gender. This is humanity against the absence of it.

In life, or in death, I stand here today to show my solidarity with Gaza, and all other people’s who have suffered at the hands of American and Israeli imperialism.

That’s it. That’s the post. God bless you, and may we all see the other side of this, together.",NummyLongHog,2024-01-15,15,0.89,2,-1

1977ns6,Why has the 2023-2024 conflict had the most Palestinian casualties than the others?,"Hi all, usually I would say something like ""hope you are well"", but I know that deep down, there's a lot troubling us at the moment.

Factually, the number of Palestinians (and especially the civilians) who have lost their lives to this recent conflict is confronting, deeply tragic, unnecessary, and infuriating.

So why has this recent conflict in particular been the most destructive one?

I'm sure there are a mix of reasons why, and I'm curious to hear as many as possible. But if there is one major reason why, I would be very interested to know. 

P.S. I recently read a Palestinian-supportive article about one particular reason why. But as I look through more articles, I'm not really seeing that reason appear. So I want to wait until a good variety of opinions have been shared first before I talk about the reason mentioned by that article.

P.P.S.: yes, I am aware that a number of Israelis have also been killed in this conflict too. Since I'm new to this subreddit and trying to be careful not to break any rules, I won't discuss Israeli deaths any further.

196qbxk,How the Gaza Genocide parallels the Armenian Genocide,"I was reading this article about the Armenian Genocide, and I couldn't help but see the similarities between that and the current genocide in Gaza.

[https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/armenian\_genocide](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/armenian_genocide)

I wanted to leave this sub with some quotes that I guarantee sounds very familiar to anyone following Gaza.

 

“Almost immediately, the government ordered the deportation of Armenians from cities, towns, and villages in the east, ostensibly as a necessary military measure to ensure the security of the rear. Soon Armenians throughout the country were forced to gather what belongings they could carry or transport and leave their homes at short notice. The exodus of Armenians was haphazard and brutal; irregular forces, local Kurds, and Circassians, cut down hundreds of thousands of Christians, as civil and military officials oversaw and facilitated the removal of the Empire’s Armenian and Assyrian subjects…Women, children, and old men in town after town were marched through the valleys and mountains of eastern Anatolia.”

“A government had come to believe that among its subject peoples whole “nations” presented an immediate threat to the security of the state. Defense of the Empire and of the “Turkish nation” became the rationale for mass murder.”

“The purpose of the genocide was to eliminate the perceived threat of the Armenians within the Ottoman Empire by reducing their numbers and scattering them in isolated, distant places, and to replace them with Muslim refugees who had fled from the Balkans.”

“A perfectly rational (and rationalist) explanation, then, for the genocide appears to be adequate: a strategic goal to secure the Empire by elimination of an existential threat to the state and the Turkish (or Islamic) people.”

“Had there been no World War there would have been no genocide, not only because there would have been no “fog of war” to cover up the events but because the radical sense of endangerment among Turks would not have been as acute.”

“Ziya Gökalp, who like so many others saw the genocide as necessary or even forced on the Ottomans, could with confidence write, 'there was no Armenian massacre, there was a Turkish-Armenian arrangement. They stabbed us in the back, we stabbed them back.' What was done had to be done in the name of national security, and so a kind of lawful lawlessness was permitted.”

“The Young Turks’ sense of their own vulnerability… fed a fantasy that the Armenians presented an existential threat to Turks, not only an immediate menace but a future peril as well.”

“The Young Turks acted on fears and resentments that had been generated over time and directed their efforts to resolve their anxieties by dealing with those they perceived to threaten their survival - not with their external enemies but an internal enemy they saw allied to the Entente - the Armenians.”

“Like many other states, including Australia, Israel, and the United States, the emergence of the Republic of Turkey involved the removal and subordination of native peoples who had lived on its territory prior to its founding. By the act of genocide, the Young Turks prepared the ground for the Turkish national state, the republic founded by Mustafa Kemal (1881-1938), that now occupies the Anatolian peninsula. Once the Greeks were driven into the sea at Smyrna in 1922 and Cilicia cleared of Armenians, the Turkish nationalists gained a homeland for the Turkish people.”",DosLosMango,2024-01-14,32,0.83,6,0

Israel is not supposed to be a nuclear power. They’ve also shown with the use of Hannibal or whatever it’s directive name is now, on October 7 that there is a willingness to “go there”. The ongoing rhetoric from the government also confirms this, with one minister even calling for the use of nuclear weapons against the Palestinians in Gaza.

If we're going to be critical of one party then we also have to be critical of the other. Otherwise it's an untruthful bias.

Yemeni rebel forces were allegedly attacking trade ships traveling through the Red Sea. This is apparently in response to Israel & the United States' genocidal oppression of the Palestinian people in Gaza.

The US and UK governments have failed to acknowledge the plight of the Palestinian people with tone deaf silence and instead opted for lethal retaliation. 
They are in no way ignorant to this plight because they are collaborators and perpetrators of countless innocent deaths in Gaza! They have deflected the situation completely.

This brings us to the unpleasant truth: the leadership of this world, those in the top positions of political power and economic power are evil. Government & banking.
This world is currently being controlled by people with vested interests who have absolutely no issue exploiting and killing to further their own selfish motives. 

The military industrial complex controls the United States. People are merely resources to keep the war machine turning. 
Any high-sounding words they speak about humanitarian values are simply to hoodwink the masses. Nothing they say or do can be trusted.

The US military complex and foreign policy has a lot to answer for. To intentionally overlook this is to mislead. If they truly wanted to liberate the Middle East from Islamic oppression they would have done so, but that's not their goal. It's a pitiful excuse at best. 

Oppression breeds rebellion and extremism. If you want to truly solve extremism look at and address the rudimental causes, otherwise violence begets violence ad nauseum. 

The world is being exploited and people are being exploited. Until people realize this it will never stop. The ruling class is actively attempting to break the neck of humanity and leave it crippled forever. 

Only solidarity can save us. There's no other recourse.

TL;DR: The world is being exploited. Human society must be united to deal with inimical forces. Objective analysis of various political and economic situations and conflicts can be attributed to vested interests.",Ok-Ingenuity4274,2024-01-14,12,1.0,1,1

The Palestinian Arabs are not alone. The Syrians are coming to help. From our point of view, they are strangers; in the point of law they are foreigners; but to the Arabs, they are not foreigners at all ... The center of the war is in Palestine, but its dimensions are much wider. When we say that the Arabs are the aggressors and we defend ourselves — this is only half the truth.*

*As regards our security and life we defend ourselves and our moral and physical position is not bad. We can face the gangs... and were we allowed to mobilize all our forces we would have no doubts about the outcome... But the fighting is only one aspect of the conflict which is in its essence a political one. And politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves. Militarily, it is we who are on the defensive who have the upper hand ... but in the political sphere, they are superior.*

*The land, the villages, the mountains, the roads are in their hands. The country is theirs because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view, we want to take away from them their country, while we are still outside.""*

Ladies and gentlemen, this was **Ben Gurion** in 1938, 10 years before he became the 1st Prime Minister of Israel. This quote is extracted from the speech he held at the Mapai Political Committee on the 7th of June and it's taken from the book titled ""Zionism and the Palestinians"" written by **Simha Flapan,** Israeli historian and National Secretary of the 'left' Zionist Mapam party, and the director of its Arab Affairs department from 1959 to the mid-1970s.

South Africa is demanding an emergency suspension of Israel's aerial and ground assault on Gaza in front of the United Nations' highest court. 

From The Hague, we hear from Diala Shamas, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, the organization that sued President Biden in November, accusing him of failing to prevent genocide in Gaza. Shamas recaps the two days of hearings and discusses other avenues for holding Israel accountable. 

""Whether it's at the ICJ or whether it's in federal court in the United States, we're really looking to government to do everything that they can to uphold their duty to prevent an unfolding genocide,"" says Shamas.",Joonam_s2,2024-01-13,37,0.96,4,-1

195h7jy,"US aid to Israel, Palestine and Ukraine","**U.S. Aid to Israel**

Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has given Israel a substantial amount of aid, with recent figures indicating a total of approximately $318 billion. [1]

Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Israel is guaranteed $3.3 billion in U.S. military aid each year, with an additional $500 million for missile defense funding through 2028, totaling $38 billion. In 2023, President Joe Biden requested $14.3 billion in aid for Israel from Congress, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a plan providing $14.5 billion in military aid for Israel. This reinforces the U.S.'s position as the largest provider of military assistance to Israel since World War II, with more than $124 billion in aid. [2]

**U.S. Aid to Palestine**

Since 1950, the U.S. has given more than $11 billion to the Palestinian territories. The annual aid to the Palestinians has been around $600 million per year, totaling $5.6 billion since 1994. [3]

In 2021, the U.S. contributed $150 million to UNRWA with specific conditions, and in 2022, it was the largest single donor to UNRWA, contributing $344 million. Additionally, since April 2021, the U.S. has provided over half a billion dollars in assistance for the Palestinians, including humanitarian and economic support. [4][5]

**US Aid to Ukraine**

**Military Assistance**
The Department of State has reported approximately $44.2 billion in military assistance since the invasion (feb 2022) and over $47 billion since Russia's initial incursion in 2014. In fiscal year 2023, the US notified Congress of its intent to invest an additional $1.1 billion in long-term investments to bolster Ukraine's security. The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system has active sales cases with Ukraine totaling $595.9 million. [6][7]

**Humanitarian and Economic Support**
Beyond military aid, the US has directed more than $75 billion in assistance to Ukraine, encompassing humanitarian, financial, and military support. This includes nearly $387 million in additional humanitarian assistance and over $1 billion in new funding for those affected by the war. USAID has invested $131 million to counter the war's impact and strengthen Ukraine's resilience, democracy, economy, and healthcare systems. More than 40 USAID programs support Ukraine's efforts against corruption and Kremlin aggression. [8]
[9]

**Development and Infrastructure**
USAID has provided over $800 million in development assistance and launched initiatives like AGRI-Ukraine to support the agriculture sector with a $100 million investment. The agency has also delivered generators and other equipment to help repair Ukraine's infrastructure. [10][11]

**International Support**
European countries and EU institutions have collectively pledged over $145 billion in aid since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion. [12]

**Oversight and Future Funding**
Congress has appropriated funds for oversight of US assistance to Ukraine, including $42 million for the Government Accountability Office and the Offices of the Inspectors General. Legislation has been proposed to establish a Special Inspector General for Ukraine. President Biden has requested additional appropriations for Ukraine, including $24 billion in economic and security assistance, which is expected to last three to four months if approved. [13][14][15][16]

**Conclusion**
So in conclusion Israel got 29x more aid than Palestine ($318B VS $11B) and Ukraine got 8.3x more aid then Palestine ($91.2B (only counting from 2014) VS $11B (lifetime))

It's the f-d up view that Israel is somehow ""liberating"" Gaza and saving its women. These Western NGO's don't get it. What difference does it make if you want to save the women of Gaza when Israel is butchering them? You want to go there, set up an office, get raped by the IDF and get bombed and killed? 

Let's not forget to mention the rape culture that exists in Israel and in the IDF. If you want to save women in Gaza, oppose Zionism and Israel's genocide? 

The article even mentions how Israel is killing her whole family.

194re63,"All genocides are committed in ""self-defense""","Israel is defending itself today at the ICJ against accusations of genocide brought by South Africa. The main argument Israel is using is that they are only acting ""in self-defense"". 

First off, I want to say that there is nothing in the [definition of genocide](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) nor in precedence from previous genocide trials that would make Israel no longer guilty of genocide if they argue that they were defending themselves or that Hamas also wanted to genocide them. Genocide is any or multiple of the five specified genocidal acts outline in [Article II of the Genocide Convention](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) taken against a group with the intent to destroy them. Nothing more, nothing more less, there are no attenuating circumstances.

Secondly, pretty much every single genocide ever committed was defended by its perpetrators as an act of ""self-defense"" : 

&nbsp;

> The wartime commander of the Bosnian Serbs, Ratko Mladic, opened his defence against charges of genocide and crimes against humanity on Monday, when one of his officers claimed that his troops only fired in **self-defence** during their 44-month siege of Sarajevo. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/19/ratko-mladic-witness-sarajevo-siege-bosnian-serbs-hague-trial)

&nbsp;

> The killings (of Tutsi by Hutus during the Rwanda genocide) were justified as **self-defence**, part of civil war or ethnic self-determination of the ‘majority’ population. [Source](https://www.iss.nl/en/news/elementary-forms-collective-denial-1994-rwanda-genocide-0).

&nbsp;

> Under these circumstances, with the Russians advancing along a wide front in the East, with the Armenian guerillas spreading death and destruction while at the same time attacking the Ottoman armies from the rear, with the Allies also attacking the Empire along a wide front from Galicia to Iraq, from the Dardanelles to Caucasus, the Ottoman decision to relocate Armenians from the war areas was a moderate and entirely legitimate measure of **self defense**. [Official Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs Source](https://www.mfa.gov.tr/data/DISPOLITIKA/ErmeniIddialari/ArmenianGenocideFactsandFiguresRevised.pdf) which denies the Armenian genocide.

&nbsp;


>The Indonesian government version is that elements of Fretilin, the armed independence organization, deliberately organized a mass political demonstration using the pretext of a mass for Gomes to do so, stabbed an Indonesian army officer, then lobbed a hand grenade into the crowd, causing the Indonesian army to open fire in **self-defense**. [Source](https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/pdfs/i/indonesa/indonesi911.pdf). Indonesian Army justification for the Dili massacre, part of the East Timor genocide. 

&nbsp;

Even the Nazis claimed they were defending themselves when they committed the holocaust. A quote from Rudolf Höss, commander of the extermination camp of Auschwitz :

In terms of pro-israeli news stations there is a lot more to choose from. For starters Israeli reps speak English on every western media tv. So obviously there is a huge pro-israeli narrative when it comes to watching western stations. But when it comes to hearing more palestinian coverage on western stations, there is almost. nothing.

So what is the most real unbiased news media station for following the coverage of this war?",walian20,2024-01-13,5,0.78,10,-1

1950j3e,I don't envy zionists,"The average everyday life of a zionist settler is built upon self-affirming lies. I saw a post earlier on a different sub that I *won't* name, by an israeli supposedly addressing the claims of genocide. It goes to show the levels of mental gymnastics these people get to, trying to justify their actions. The post simply went as follows:

* Accusing us of genocide is very bad for us.
* I don't have an actual argument to refute this, so let's make up a hypothetical scenario.
* If what we did was genocide, then what if we did more *harder* genocide? would this still be genocide?
* the only reason we didn't do more genocide is because of public opinion aka ""I don't have a moral compass"" aka ""I don't care about palestinian life, only my reputation""
* to absolve myself of any blame, genocide bad.

Like this is the shit they have to come up with to sleep at night. If you're ever debating a zionist or an israeli online, remember they are extremely fragile and self-contradicting. It is so so easy to prove they are bad people. It is so easy that the point shifts from proving the truth, to making them believe the truth about themselves. They are always on the verge of believing it too. If you press them a bit further, they crumble.

1952ywi,How best to spend money if trying to help,"I have moderate means at my disposal and don't want to let this massacre go by as in Rwanda, ignored by everyone with the resources to help. If you could spend $50,000 (or even multiples of that number if I feel I can do any good) to help, what would would one spend it on? I'm hoping to be as pragmatic as possible. The aim is to save as many lives as possible, particularly children in the here and now, not to finance the longer term struggle (I see inaction in the face of genocide when one lives in the west as a form of complicity). My sense is that it may be best achieved by spending money in the west not Gaza, since sending it to the ME is like sending funds to war criminals in the hope that they will distribute it to their victims. Given the blockade it would likely result in it's confiscation by the death camp guards.

In particular, I feel the chief obstacle is fear of being labelled antisemetic, and that challenging people to be brave in a moment or need while clarifying the distinction between anti Zionism and anti semitism might be the best way to mobilise further support. I also think finding 'white-ish' western appearing supporters is essential, since the Israel lobby was so effective at painting dark skinned protesters wearing Palestinian flags as terrorists and outsiders.

My other idea is to attempt to bring the message to workers for shipping companies that transport armaments (I live in the UK, home of BAE systems). I think the second course of action might be more effective by targetting unbiased personnel unwittingly doing a great deal of harm. Disrupting shipping would also attract a lot of attention and make people conscious that , as opposed to protests that seemed to have achieved little, civil disobedience is an option.

Alternately if anyone has found a particular poster, pamphleteering, or recruiting effective advocates to be particularly effective as a mode of drawing public attention to the issue, which is the only way the ICJ trial is likely to have any efrect, I'd be happy to consider paying for it's distribution or promulgation.

Does anyone have any better ideas?",aa1607,2024-01-12,8,1.0,3,1

194tcts,Either it has never occured to Israel to study about what genocide actually means of they're deliberately cynical,"I guess the delegation tasked with presenting a response before the ICJ over allegations brought fowards by South Africa before this same court a day prior is either chronically ill from the head or it does seriously believe the spinning lies it exhales.

Chances are that perhaps, as Israel's despair grows stinkier, the scarecrows representing the macabre regime were running out of time to decently indocrinate lawyers to rush at Israel's rescue before the ICJ in the spite of factually irrefutable evidences amounting to war crimes and pinpointed explicit human rights violations, ranging from torture all the way to ethnical cleasing, presented by the plaintiff. So, apparently, these designated lawyers were the only ones out there willing to undergo the task.

However the Israel's smearing campaign against Palestine has made them dowright blinded by verbose. The defense is ludricrous and lacks the basic of apprehension over juridical skills to sound credible.

The only argumentative baseline the contortionists on behalf of Israel have in their sleeves is a well known tactic to conceal their real selves: to establish a pompous parallel, presumably, between Hamas' lawlessness and stark disdain toward the nurtiring principles and conventions surrouding human rights and Israel's righteouness to defend its own sovereignty as an explanation to justify a genocide. But it's unsubstantiated in its core.

The attorneys addressing the case affirm that the reason Israel deliberately carries airstrikes on civilian targets in Gaza lies on a single premise: quote ""Hamas is a terrorist organization that seeks to harm Israel"" unquote.

But if Hamas is a terrorist group as they argue, then a terrorist group's modus operandi is to, suggestively, disregard the law plain and simple. So is Israel, by following the so called a ""terrorist group"" footsteps and imitate what a terrorist group did to declare a reciprocal retaliation to an unjust agression they say they suffered on Oct 7th wouldn't make them also terrorists?

I'd be imperative for a law abiding state to behave differently and minimize distress/miscalculation, not in Israel's case it seems.",Puzzleheaded_Fish499,2024-01-12,8,1.0,1,-1

Around 4pm CST, I open up Apple News expecting to see a multitude of headlines on it. Much to my horror, it was the opposite. It wasn't mention in the categories UN, Middle East, Israel-Hamas War, or Politics that I follow. It wasn't until I reached the 67th headline that it was mentioned under the Israel category, and the headline was ""Netanyahu Condemns ICJ Case"".

4 hours later, I just checked again at 8pm CST giving benefit of the doubt that the press simply needed more time to publish them. After scrolling through 100+ headlines, it wasn't mentioned AT ALL.

194006t,FOR ISRAELI'S BRINGING UP SOUTH AFRICA'S APARTHEID PAST.,"LET US NOT FORGET: 

Israel openly propped up apartheid South Africa but did not disclose all of their relations. At first they were seen as Nazi sympathizers, 30 years later, this same government was being honoured and feted in Jerusalem.

“Blacks in South Africa want to gain control over the white minority just like the Arabs here want to gain control over us. And we, like the white minority in South Africa, must act to prevent them from taking over.” Former Israeli chief of staff, general Rafael Eitan.

ANC declassified a lot of documents and revealed the extent of this relationship when it came into power.

In 1976, two years after they honour the regime, The Soweto uprising (or Soweto riots) was a series of demonstrations and protests led by black school children in South Africa during apartheid that began on the morning of 16 June 1976, in this protest, these demonstrators were mowed down with guns and bullets supplied by Israel. After a UN arms embargo was placed on South Africa, Israel continued to advocate and supply them.

Israel had shared nuclear bomb tech with the apartheid government that goes back to 1975.

“Israel could face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights, and as soon as that happens, the state of Israel is finished. - Ehud Olmert.

*Israel consistently supply weapons to white colonial rules, the client regimes in a bit to go against anti colonial liberation movements.*

*This is prevalent in Africa and South America (right wing insurgents)*

193j8jv,Chicago doc who served in Gaza describes the scenes. Literal Hell.,"Below is a description of what a Doctor from Chicago saw and did in Gaza for 2 weeks as a volunteer MD. I'm leaving his name out to protect his privacy. Got this from a reliable source. I can't provide a source so if you don't want to believe it, don't. But this is basically corroborated by all accounts afaik.

=========

I just got back home today to Chicago after two weeks there

It was the worst I’d seen in my career.  A catastrophic nightmare 

If things don’t improve I would only recommend small surgical teams

Things were at a breaking point the day we left and the neighborhoods around the hospital were collapsing and evacuating 

The hospital ran out of basic supplies for surgery and pain management.  Many patients were just being left to sit with open wounds and open fractures.  There were 1000 patients at a hospital designed for 250 beds.  

Some days it felt that more dead bodies were showing up to the ER than living patients you could actually treat 

Hopefully the war is over by February because then they’re gonna need everyone to show up and help.

Here were my findings

I jotted these observations down in between surgeries. I did more amputations in 2 weeks than I have in 1 year

Our first 4 days here  I could only describe as chaotic and catastrophic and horrifying.  We decided to leave Nassar hospital because we saw two mass casualty events and three riots in one day. Not safe.  It felt like it was about to he sieged at any moment 

We moved to a bigger hospital in the south:  The hospital is designed for 250 beds.  More than 1000 patients are  living here.   We have 500 ortho patients and all of them are disasters.  There aren’t enough staff or resources to fix them all.  I pulled a chunk of shrapnel out of a lady’s pelvis.  She was injured 6 weeks ago.  Her 10 year old daughter had to apply pressure with t shirts to a large open wound for 4 hours until the ambulance arrived.  Most people like her just died in the field or at home.  If they end up at the hospital care has to get delayed because there are so many that need it.  Everyone has lost multiple immediate family members.  10000 people are squatting in and around the hospital compound sleeping on the floor in the corridors.  Doctors and nurses do the same. People living on top of each other like ants. There are 20000 people surrounding the hospital.  Everyone is in survival mode in tented camps.  Garbage litters the streets and is accumulating right next to the water supply.
We have witnessed riots and people fight each other for food and water and access to a handful of toilets.  This place is pulsing with despair and rage and feels ready to burst at any moment. 

Outside isn’t safe.  Bombs drop around the clock and shake the foundations and the walls.  No one reacts any more.  They are used to it all.  It feels like there are daily mass casualty events that would overwhelm any hospital system. Many of the victims show up crushed or burned or dead.  Dead children wrapped in little white shrouds.  Not enough beds so they put patients on the floor.  

Doctors have been living and working here nonstop for 80 days. They are exhausted and feel hopeless.  The numbers are increasing each day.  Doctors on call are going to the ED to find out that their daughters or their husbands are among the dead or injured after the latest airstrike.  The brother of the CEO of the hospital was killed right outside a hospital after an airstrike in front of it.  He had to go Immediately back to work and could not bury his brother.  death here is so prevalent and accepted like birth. Everyone has a story like this—losing two kids or two brothers or both parents or both limbs all at the same

Those are my immediate unfiltered reactions to what I witnessed there.  It sucked to be there but it was so meaningful to do the job, help these people who have nothing left, and work alongside these doctors and relieve some of their physical and psychic burdens

The focus in the hospital is mainly emergency surgical.  There’s really no infrastructure for primary care.  The health system has been totally dismantled

185diib,I am an American who lived in Palestine—our governments are gaslighting us.,"I taught in Palestine for 7 months from 2020-2021 and it has happened many times that I’ve had to go to bat for Palestinian people but the blatant lies that we are being told about its people and its culture recently is insane to me. 

The idea that Palestinian people are terrorists, that women don’t have rights there, that they would murder you if you were gay. This propoganda by Israel that’s repeated by J*e Biden makes my blood boil. They are all LIES. 

Palestinian people are to this day, the friendliest people I’ve ever met. Living there made me take a long hard look at my life and it was a huge factor in my not wanting to return to Europe because people were just so mean and miserable. 

I was invited into peoples homes after exchanging a few words with them. My belongings and groceries were returned to me after being chased down for it. People always offered me rides when they saw me walking in the hot sun. Feasts were prepared upon arrival into entering people’s homes. A group of ladies invited my coworker and I into their hamam party where they were just dancing and singing in a circle. 

Even when the situation with Israel was spoken about, not one antisemitic word. My students didn’t say anything hateful, they always expressed, “the Israelis want to kills us.” 

Seeing people curate the narrative for a people who is constantly denied autonomy is just making my blood boil. The messed up thing is that it’s so difficult to go there. My visa had to be bribed as it is Israel who approved it, but it is very hard to go there legally. They make it almost impossible for a Palestinian to leave as well. 

Never stop talking about this. These people deserve their freedom and autonomy. We will not be shamed into speaking up for what’s right. Free Palestine!",TarquinOliverNimrod,2023-11-27,2528,0.93,149,0

* My brother had to leave the crammed one bed flat where 25 people were sheltering with his two kids and is now looking for a place to crash. They are walking with their suitcases from one shelter to another.

* I can’t even send them money because the Israelis ordered all wiring services to stop accepting payments into Gaza.

* People who are paid by the PA can’t get paid because Israel is blocking the payments.

* It’s really depressing and sad and infuriating. The worst feeling is that of being powerless unable to do anything to help. 

* I know I should be grateful they are still alive unlike thousands of other Palestinians but what life is this?

* If there is no fuel left by Thursday all communications and internet services will stop.

I wish I could add the pictures on here of the message as well, but it basically says: ""The reddit admin team has been alerted that you've violated reddit rule against threatening violence in the following content .... We don't tolerate any behaviour that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual, groups of people, places,  or animals .... Any communities or people that encourage or incite violence ..... will be banned.

I'm actually super confused and pissed off. Does this mean someone reported the post? And if so, how the fuck did they decide that the video was harmful. I'm really upset. If this is the case then reddit has just shown its true colours. And the admins are a bunch of zionist facist pigs.

Their warning won't stop me from posting the truth. I can make accounts whenever I want. 
But the Palestinians dying and suffering can't return to the way it was magically or come back from death. 

Thats why, even if its just a few of us, we must continue speaking up and sharing hoping it will reach a big audience. That's the very least we can do. They might ban us, but that shouldn't keep any of you from posting the truth. Don't be scared of empty threats. What's reddit gonna do? I'm more afraid of our brothers and sisters being forgotten.

Even if my posts will reach only 1 person. I'm more than happy by taking part in the war against apartheid, zionism, fascism and their inhuman agenda.",YlangYlang66,2023-04-07,1777,0.91,90,-1

18enbw1,Being called an antisemite is heartbreaking,"I am a black woman born in the Caribbean, living in New York. I grew up dirt floor poor. But very Christian. My mother's dream was to go to Israel. Even though the term was never used, I supposed she would be considered a Christian zionist. Thankfully, in retrospect, we could barely eat day to day, so my mother was never complicit by traveling to Israel. Our only exposure to Jews were the stories in the Bible. However, the first time I learned about the Israel/ Palestinian story, I knew in my gut that it was a great injustice. It just never made any sense. If I believed in equality of all people, I clearly could not support an ethno-religious state. I always saw the Palestinians as a group of people fked over by history. And one day, when I was long dead the world would finally come to realize the evil done to them. I just put it in the back of my mind and moved on. 

Then when October 7th happened, suddenly this thing was in the news and couldn't be avoided. Then I felt like the whole fkn world was gaslighting me as every single western nation gave Israel Carte Blanche to kill as many Palestinians as they wanted and major celebs were voicing approval of the bombing campaign. Then the idea that anyone who didn't support the slaughter was an antisemite became the talking point de jour. I felt like I was taking crazy pills. But my gut that told me as a young girl that th3 Palestinians were oppressed would not go away. And though I pride myself for being what I call a radical egalitarian, I have to live with the fact that saying the TRUTH means I can and will be labeled an antisemite.

Doing this, going area by area, in a targeted boycott is a brilliant way to bring people on board with boycotting israeli goods. We have also seen the Beechmount Residents Collective in Belfast say they will be trying to speak with local businesses about stocking israeli goods as well. This area by area targeted boycott is a great idea that hopefully spreads throughout Ireland and others try worldwide as well.

17emxho,I used to be pro-Palestinian,"I used to be pro-Palestinian. I thought Israel was wrong for carpet bombing Gaza and using siege warfare on civilians.  

But then I ran into a very wise Israel apologist who changed my way of looking at things forever. 

 I was walking down the street and I saw him leaning against a lamp post, smoking a pipe as wise men do.  “Your shirt says Free Palestine,” he said from behind a plume of smoke.  

“Yep!” I replied.  

“So I guess that means you love Hamas then?” spake he. 

 I stopped in my tracks. I’d never thought of it that way before.  Could it be? Could my opposition to murdering civilians really be indicative of a deep affection for a Gazan militant group? Maybe I really did love Hamas and think everything it did on October 7 was great and wonderful?  

“Is this really how I want to live my life?” I thought to myself.  

“I — I — I…” I said out loud.  

“Or perhaps,” he said with a raised eyebrow, “you just HATE JEWS??” 

 I fell to my knees.  

Oh my God. He really had a point. What possible reason could anyone have for opposing military explosives being dropped on buildings full of children besides a seething lifelong hatred of adherents to the religion of Judaism? How could anyone possibly oppose siege warfare tactics which cut off civilians from food and water and electricity and fuel and medical supplies unless they harbored a dangerous hostility toward members of a small Abrahamic faith?  

“Who… who are you?” I asked.  

“That’s of no consequence,” he said, casually blowing a smoke ring through another larger smoke ring.  

“But… but the children,” I stammered as my entire worldview crumbled before my eyes. “The civilians! They’re dying! Isn’t it bad that they’re dying?”  

And then he went for the coup de grâce. 

&#x200B;

 “Have you considered,” he said before a pregnant pause, “… that all of those deaths are the fault of Hamas?”  

I fell flat on my back. The world was spinning. A trickle of blood ran down into my hair from my ear.  

I felt all the anti-colonialism leaving my body. I suddenly could no longer remember why I thought it was bad to rain down military explosives on a densely populated concentration camp. 

 Everything went black.  

When I finally came to, the mysterious stranger was gone. But his wisdom and profound insights into Israel and Gaza will always live on in my heart.

177etxz,I offer my deepest apologies,"Don't know how to start. 

I wanna offer my deepest apologies to palestinians here and all around the world. A few years ago, I was rabidly pro-israel. I used to passionately defend Israel and say the most awful things about palestinians. 

But, I realized afterwards that Israel isn't the democracy I imagined it to be. So I just became indifferent and neutral. I thought that both sides sucked equally. I still talked awful things about Palestine. 

But now, with this horror happening in Gaza, I have seen the naked ugly face of Israeli apartheid and brutality. It's no different than apartheid South Africa and I have seen how Palestinians are second-class citizens in their own ancestral lands, ravaged by colonizers.

Looking back at it, I'm incredibly ashamed of myself for having ever been pro-Israel. I'm overcome with regret. I don't know how I ever could support Israel, don't know what I was thinking. What Israel is doing against civilians in Gaza is just pure evil.

I don't blame any of you if you won't forgive me. I myself have a hard time forgiving myself. For what it's worth, I support Palestine all the way now.
